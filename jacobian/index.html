  <h1> The Jacobian </h1>

  <section>
  <p>
  In this article, I'm going to motivate a geometric quantity known as the
  Jacobian you may have seen in multivariable calculus. It shows up without
  explanation when one solves multiple integrals; little explanation is given
  to what it <em> means </em>. At the end of reading this, if you knew what 
  a Jacobian is, you'll have a sense of what it really means. If you didn't,
  even better --- you'll learn what the Jacobian is!
  </p>
  <p>
  Let's dive in. To discuss the Jacobian, we first need a transformation. A prototypical 
  example the transformation that squeezes the entire plane into the unit circle. This is given by
  \( f(v) \equiv v/|v| \) where \( v \) is a 2D vector, or a point on a plane. Written
  in terms of coordinates, we make the substitution \( v \mapsto (x, y) \), and the length
  of the vector \( |v| \mapsto \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This yields the expression
  \( f(x, y) \equiv (x/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, y/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) \).  To get a very visceral sense
  of what this function does, let's think about it this way: distribute pink-colored points randomly, and then
  transform using \( f\). This gives a sense of how \( f \) crumples the unit plane
  onto the unit circle.
  </p>
  <div id="crumple"></div>
  <p>
  However, there's another way to view this transform, which will be slightly more fruitful for us in the future; We're going
  to look at how this function $f$ transforms <em>curves</em>, because a curve is the most primitive object
  that has notions of continuity, smoothness, and all other nice geometic properties we know and love from
  calculus. We have a pink curve that moves around. This curve is mapped by \( f \)
  to the blue curve that lies entirely on the unit circle. Watching this
  transformation gives us a sense of what geometry the mapping \( f \) preserves and destroys
  </p>
  <div id="transform-anim"></div>

  <p>
  To watch more closely, let's consider two extreme cases. First, where the pink
  curve is perpendicular to the circle. Here, we see below that that the projection in blue
  vanishes. Regardless of however long our pink curve is, the projection is always just a single
  point. A curve that is <em> perpendicular </em> to the circle will have zero projection.

  <div id="transform-anim-normal"></div>
  </p>


  <p>
  The other case we consider is where the curve is tangent or parallel to the circle. Here,
  we find the projection of the pink curve to be very long, as the pink curve is able to cast
  a long shadow onto the circle.
  </p>

  Finally, if you wish to play with the transform, I've left

  <input type="checkbox" id="best-viewed-desktop-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
  <span class="marginnote"> Best viewed on the desktop </span>
  where you can draw a curve with your mouse. The curve after $f$ is applied,
  is displayed  in blue.

  <h2> Transformation of derivatives along a curve </h2>

  <p>
  We now have a handle on how <em> continuity </em> is transformed. Let's now try to understand
  how <em> tangents </em> or derivatives are transformed, since differentiability comes right after
  continuity in Differential calculus. To explore this, let's draw the simplest curve possible: a straight line.
  Let's see where this curve is mapped to by \( f \), and then draw the mapped curve's tangents.


  <p>
  But, what even <em> is </em>
  a tangent? Calculus tells us that it's a straight line that just touches our curve. So we'll draw
  the tangent as a straight line to our curve, then push the tangent onto the circle using \( f \)
  to see what it looks like after the transformation. 
  </p>

  <p>
  We represent the straight line as function $c: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb
  R^2$; $c(t) \equiv (t, 0)$. That is, it's a curve with a point that moves
  along the $x$ axis as $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$. Let's plot the point that
  moves, along with a straight line at that point, and see how this gets
  mapped:
  </p>

  <div id="static-derivative"></div>

  <p>
  We see that the length of the orange tangent on the circle is not constant,
  even though the length of the purple tangent is constant! As the blue point
  comes closer to the circle, the orange tangent attached to the pink point is
  longer, since the pink point moves faster on the circle. As the blue point
  goes farther away from the circle, the length of the orange tangent grows
  ever shorter, while the speed of the pink point on the circle crawls to a
  halt.  Can we calculate this somehow?
  </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  <h2> Calculating the tangent on the circle </h2>

  <p>
  We started with the blue point on the curve curve $c(t) \equiv (t, 0)$.
  We then drew a blue tangent, $c'(t) = (1, 0)$. This was the blue line of constant length.
  Next, we drew the analogous pink point on the curve. This was computed as $d(t) \equiv f(c(t))$,
  since we took a point on the curve $c$ and saw where it lands due to $f$'s action. Next, we differentiated
  this curve $d(t)$ to get the pink line $d'(t)$. We wish to relate $c'(t)$ and $d'(t)$. 
  </p>

  <img src="transform-terms.png"/>
  <p>

  In the concrete case, we find:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  & d'(t) = \\
  & \text{(defn of $d$)}\\
  & = (f(c(t))'  \\
  &= \frac{d f(c(t))}{dt} \\
  & \text{(substitute $c(t) = (t, 0)$)}\\ 
  &= \frac{d f(t, 0)}{dt}  \\
  & \text{(substitute $f$)} \\ 
  &= \frac{d ((t/\sqrt{t^2 + 0^2}, 0/\sqrt{t^2 + 0^2}))}{dt}  \\
  & \text{(simplify)} \\
  &= \frac{d ((\sqrt{t}, 0))}{dt}  \\
  & \text{(push derivative inside)}\\ 
  &= \bigg( \frac{d\sqrt{t}}{dt}, \frac{d0}{dt} \bigg) \\
  &d'(t) = \bigg (\frac{1}{2\sqrt{t}}, 0 \bigg) \quad 
  \end{align*}
  $$

  Thus, we find that the derivative of the curve $d(t)$ is $d'(t) = (1/2\sqrt{t}, 0)$. This grows smaller
  as $t$ grows larger in size, mimicking what we saw. As we grow farther away from the center, the pink line
  on the circle  grew smaller and smaller.
  </p>

      <h2> Transformation of derivative with fixed basepoint </h2>
      <p>
      The math tells us that at each point, the derivative is $d'(t) = (1/2\sqrt{t}, 0)$.
      This means that for a <em> chosen point </em>, say $t = 1$, the derivative is going to be

      $$d'(t=1) = (1/2\sqrt 1, 0) = (1/2, 0).$$

      The derivative of the original curve at the same point is $c'(1) = d/dt(t, 0)|_{t=1} = (1, 0)|_{t=1} = (1, 0)$.
      That's curious, the new derivative $d'(t)$ seems to be a <em> scaled proportionally </em> 
      from the old derivative:
      
      $$
      d'(t) = (1/2, 0) = 1/2(1, 0) = 1/2 c'(t).
      $$

      This means that the tangents on the straight line are
      <em> proportionally </em> related to tangents on the circle.  Is this
      true? Let's watch.
      </p>


      <div id="linear-derivative"></div>

      <p>
      It does seem to be true; as we vary the length of the purple tangent line on the line segment,
      the length of the orange tangent line on the circle grows proportionally! Is there something special
      about the straight line? Let's try to see what happens in general.
      </p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2> Generalizing our computation </h2>

  <p>
  Previously, we used the concrete definition of $f(x, y)$ and $c(t)$ that we knew to compute the derivative
  $d'(t)$. What happens if we perform the same derivation in the abstract? This should tell us how to compute $d'(t)$
  in terms of $f(x, y)$ and $c(t)$.  We begin by thinking about
  $c(t) : [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb R^2$. It's a little awkward to deal with, because it produces <em> two outputs </em>.
  Let's break $c(t)$ into two functions, $c_x(t)$ and $c_y(t)$, so that $c(t) = (c_x(t), c_y(t))$. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Similarly, we had 
  $f: \mathbb R^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R^2$. Let's break this into $f_x(x, y): \mathbb R^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$
  and $f_y(x, y): \mathbb R^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that $f(x, y) = (f_x(x, y), f_y(x, y))$. This gives us two
  functions $f_x, f_y: \mathbb R^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ which takes two inputs and produces a single output.
  </p>

  <p>
  We now have the simplifications we need to carry out our "concrete proof", completely abstractly. Instead of substituting
  $c(t) = (t, 0)$, we will substitute $c(t) = (c_x(t), c_y(t))$. Similarly, instead of substituting
  $f(x, y) = (x/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, y/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})$, we will substitute $f(x, y) = (f_x(x, y), f_y(x, y))$ and carry out the proof.
  This yields:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  & d'(t) = \\
  & \text{(defn of $d$)}\\
  & = (f(c(t))' = \frac{d f(c(t))}{dt} \\
  & \text{(substitute $c(t) = (c_x(t), c_y(t))$)}\\ 
  &= \frac{d f(c_x(t), c_y(t))}{dt}  \\
  & \text{(substitute $f(x, y) = (f_x(x, y), f_y(x, y)))$} \\
  &= \frac{d((f_x(c_x(t), c_y(t)), f_y(c_x(t), c_y(t))))}{dt}  \\
  & \text{(push derivative inside)}\\ 
  &= \bigg(\frac{df_x(c_x(t), c_y(t))}{dt}, \frac{df_y(c_x(t), c_y(t))}{dt} \bigg)  \\
  \end{align*}
  $$
  </p>

  <p>
  At this stage, we're going to whack the expression with the only hammer we have in calculus: the chain rule!
  This gives us:
  
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  &= \bigg(\frac{df_x(c_x(t), c_y(t))}{dt}, \frac{df_y(c_x(t), c_y(t))}{dt} \bigg)  \\
  &d'(t) = \bigg (\frac{df_x}{dx}\frac{dc_x(t)}{dt} + \frac{df_x}{dy} \frac{dc_y(t)}{dt}, \frac{df_y}{dx} \frac{dc_x(t)}{dt} + \frac{df_y}{dy}\frac{dc_y(t)}{dt} \bigg) \\
  \end{align*}
  $$

  We see that this splits into two "kinds" of derivatives: terms of the form $(dc_x/dt, dc_y/dt)$, and
  of the form $\{ df_{x, y}/d_{x, y} \}$.
  We can write the above as:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  &d'(t) = \bigg (\frac{df_x}{dx}\frac{dc_x(t)}{dt} + \frac{df_x}{dy} \frac{dc_y(t)}{dt}, \frac{df_y}{dx} \frac{dc_x(t)}{dt} + \frac{df_y}{dy}\frac{dc_y(t)}{dt} \bigg) \\
  &d'(t) = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  df_x/dx & df_x/dy \\
  dg_x/dx & dg_x/dy \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  dc_x/dt \\ dc_y/dt
  \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align*}
  $$

  So we see that we can write $d'(t)$ as a matrix multiplication (linear transformation) of $(dc_x/dt, dc_y/dt)$
  with the <em>Jacobian of $f$</em>, $J \equiv \begin{bmatrix} df_x/dx & df_x/dy \\ dg_x/dx & dg_x/dy \\ \end{bmatrix}$.
  This philosophically means that the new tangent is a <em> linear transform </em> of the old tangent.

      <h2> Wrapping Up</h2>

      <p>
      We began exploring what it means to have a complicated transformation and how to visualize it.
      We then thought about curves, and how curves are transformed under this relationship. This naturally
      got us thinking about derivatives, where we noticed that the relationship between the derivatives
      of the original curve and the transformed curve appear to be linear. This culminated in us computing
      the Jacobian, which precisely quantified the linear relationship in the tangents to the curve.

      Finally, I end with an interactive toy; Click to select a base point. Move the cursor
      to draw blue line segments. See the prediction by the Jacobian (in purple) and the real 
      projection (in orange), and revel in the fact that the pink Jacobian prediction
      and the real orange projection do indeed overlap for small approximations!
