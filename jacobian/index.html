  <h1> The Jacobian </h1>

  <section>
  <p>
  In this article, I'm going to motivate a geometric quantity known as the
  Jacobian you may have seen from multivariable calculus. It shows up without
  explanation when one solves multiple integrals; little explanation is given
  to what it <em> means </em>. At the end of reading this, if you know what 
  a Jacobian is, you'll have a sense of what it really means; If you didn't,
  that's even better --- you'll learn what the Jacobian is with no misconceptions.
  </p>
  <p>
  Let's dive in. To discuss the jacobian, we first need a transformation. Let's
  pick the transformation that squeezes the entire plane into the unit circle. This is given by
  \( f(v) \equiv v/|v| \) where \( v \) is a 2D vector, or a point on a plane. Written
  in terms of coordinates, we make the substitution \( v \mapsto (x, y) \), and the length
  of the vector \( |v| \mapsto \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This yield the expression
  \( f(x, y) \equiv (x/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, y/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) \).  to get a very visceral sense
  of what this function does, let's think about it this way: we distribute pink-colored points randomly , and then
  transform these points using \( f\). This gives a sense of how \( f \) crumples the unit plane
  onto the unit circle.
  </p>

  <p>
  There's another way to view this transform, which will be slightly more fruitful for us in the future; We're going
  to look at how this function $f$ transforms <em>curves</em>, because a curve is the most primitive object
  that has notions of continuity, smoothness, and all other nice geometic properties we know and love from
  calculus. We have a pink curve that moves around; This curve is mapped by \( f \)
  to the blue curve that lies entirely on the unit circle. Watching this
  transformation gives us a sense of what geometry the mapping \( f \) preserves,
  and what \( f \) destroys.
  </p>

  <p>
  To watch more closely, let's consider two extreme cases. First, where the pink
  curve is perpendicular to the circle. Here, we see below that that the projection in blue
  vanishes. Regardless of however long our pink curve is, the projection is always just a single
  point. A curve that is <em> perpendicular </em> to the circle will have zero projection.

  </p>


  <p>
  The other case we consider is where the curve is tangent or parallel to the circle. Here,
  we find the projection of the pink curve to be very long, as the pink curve is able to cast
  a long shadow onto the circle.
  </p>

  Finally, if you wish to play with the transform, I've left a little interactive region
  where you can draw a curve with your mouse. The curve after $f$ is applied
  is displayed  in blue.

  <h2> The transformation of derivatives </h2>

  <p>
  We now have a handle on how <em> continuity </em> is transformed. Let's now try to understand
  how <em> tangents </em> or derivatives are transformed, since differentiability comes right after
  continuity in Calculus. To explore this, let's first draw a pink curve, draw its tangents, see what
  this curve is mapped to by \( f \), and then draw the mapped curve's tangents. This should give us
  insight into how the <em> tangents to a curve </em> is transformed by \( f \). But, what even <em> is </em>
  a tangent? Calculus tells us that it's straight line that just touches our curve. So we'll draw
  the tangent as a straight line to our curve, then push the tangent onto the circle using \( f \)
  to see what it looks like after the transformation. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's draw tangents to the simplest possible curve: a straight line
  </p>

  <p>
  We see that the length of the pink tangent is not constant! As we come closer to the circle, the
  length of the tangent is longer, since the point moves faster on the circle. As we go farther away
  from the circle, the length of the tangent grows ever shorter, as the velocity on the point on
  the circle crawls to a halt.
