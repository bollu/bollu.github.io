 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x0eyNkNpL0><span class='centered'>Video talk at google </a></li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>What does violence react to? What is the everyday texture of our lives? Ideology 
 <span class='centered'>in the sense of complicated networks of social, political prejudices determines 
 <span class='centered'>the way we functions and structures our life. What is ideology?  
 <span class='centered'>Donald Rumsfield, gulf war, spoke about known knows (saddam is a dictator), 
 <span class='centered'>known unknowns ('WMD that saddam surely had'), and unknown unknowns  
 <span class='centered'>('even worse WMD that saddam may have').  
 <span class='centered'>What about unknown knowns? Things we don't know that we know? This is ideology. 
 <span class='centered'>The texture into which we are embedded.  
 <span class='centered'>European trinity: France (revolutionary, political),  
 <span class='centered'>German (conservative, poets, thinkers),  
 <span class='centered'>Anglo saxon (liberal, economy).  
 <span class='centered'>Bohr had a horsheshoe above his house. 'Do you believe in it? Aren't you a scientist?' 
 <span class='centered'>'Of course I don't believe in it! But I was told that it works regardless of my belief in it!'.  
 <span class='centered'>What is ideology today? It seems very shallow, things of the form 'go achieve', 
 <span class='centered'>and whatnot. However, there is a lot more that is tacit.  
 <span class='centered'>'Interpassivity': we transpose onto the other our passive reaction. Others are 
 <span class='centered'>passive for us. Canned laughter on TV. Literally, the TV set laughs for you. 
 <span class='centered'>You feel relief as if you have laughed.   
 <span class='centered'>Similarly it's not that we believe. We need someone else to believe for us. 
 <span class='centered'>For example, santa Claus. The parent's don't believe, they do it to not let down 
 <span class='centered'>the kids. The kids don't believe, they pretend for presents and to not let 
 <span class='centered'>down the parents. The whole system of belief functions.  
 <span class='centered'>The first person to do this politically is the isareli prime minister 
 <span class='centered'>Golda Meir. When asked 'do you believe in god'. Her answer was 'no. I believe in  
 <span class='centered'>jewish people, and they believe in God'. But atheism is ~70% of israel.  
 <span class='centered'>When different cultures are thrown together (globalism) we should break the  
 <span class='centered'>spell of liberalism: we cannot understand each other, we don't even 
 <span class='centered'>understand ourselves. I don't want to understand all cultures. We need a code 
 <span class='centered'>of discretion. How do we sincerely politely ignore each other? We need proper 
 <span class='centered'>distance to treat others in a non-racist, kind manner.  
 <span class='centered'>He upholds that we don't even miss anything deep in this way. Do I really understand 
 <span class='centered'>you? Do I really understand myself?   
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> We are the stories we are telling ourselves about ourselves. The basic <span class='centered'> freedom is to tell your side of the story. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>The motto of tolerance:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> An enemy is someone whose story I have not yet heard. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>Living libraries, people can visit minorities and talk to them. It works at a 
 <span class='centered'>certain level. But it stops working at some level. Because we would not say 
 <span class='centered'>the same of Hitler.  'The X files insight'. Truth is  <i><span class='centered'>out there </i>. It's not 
 <span class='centered'>in what you are telling yourself about yourself. The story you are telling 
 <span class='centered'>yourself is a lie.  
 <span class='centered'>Two extreme examples. One from Europe, one from far east. 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Grey Eminence </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Zen at War </li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>Corruption is prohibited officially, and it is exactly codified in a communist 
 <span class='centered'>country. Holidays in Japan. You are given 40 days. It's very impolite to take 
 <span class='centered'>more than 20 days. This creates a link between people, the link of politeness. 
 <span class='centered'>This is ideology. Prohibition is is prohibited to be stated publicly.  
 <span class='centered'>Nazi germany without glasses is 'sacrifice your country'. With glasses, it is 
 <span class='centered'>'do this, pretend to do this, we can have some fun, beat the jews'. Ideology 
 <span class='centered'>always offers you some bribery.  
 <span class='centered'>When hitler finishes giving a talk, the people clap. In a communist speech, 
 <span class='centered'>at the end of the speech, the speaker claps with the people. This is a  
 <span class='centered'>crystallization of the difference between fascism and communism.  
 <span class='centered'>'Nice to meet you, how are you?' is a sincere lie. From the very beginning 
 <span class='centered'>we entered into language, we enter into requiring one for whom we can  
 <span class='centered'>create appearances.  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN2ZGSX0cIE><span class='centered'>Zizek interview at BBC </a></li></ul> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>Embracing hopelessness means to accept that there are no easy solutions. We should 
 <span class='centered'>accept the hopelessness and start a paradigm shift.  Our tragedy is death.  
 <span class='centered'>Something will have to change fundamentally. We do not yet have the formula of 
 <span class='centered'>what to do. We can now only get ready for a global crisis.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The problem with Hitler was that he wasn't violent enough. In the same way <span class='centered'> that Gandhi was more violent than Hitler, in terms of 'systemic change'. <span class='centered'> Hitler killed millions to save the system. Gandhi killed no one to setup <span class='centered'> a radical change. Change will hurt. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>We tend to forget the violence of keeping things the same, and we only consider 
 <span class='centered'>the violence of change. Sometimes the gratest violence is to not participate.  
 <span class='centered'>Modi, China, Russia: Global market, Cultural narrowness.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Polyamory is instrumental. <span class='centered'> True love is where you cannot be without someone else. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>It is a sign of progress that some things are considered ideology. For example, 
 <span class='centered'>''is it right to kill?'' will be laughed at. The problem with current societies 
 <span class='centered'>is that we are eroding the set of things we can laugh at due to dangerous 
 <span class='centered'>ideas of relativism.  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4><span class='centered'>Zizek v/s Petersen </a></li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>Petersen: truths of the communist manifesto:  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> History is to be viewed as an economic class struggle. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Hierarchical structure is not attributable to capitalism. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> We're also in odds with nature, which never shows up in Marx. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Hierarchical structures are necessary to solve complicated problems. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Human hierarchy is not based on power. Power is a very unstable means of <span class='centered'>exploiting people. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> History comes off as a 'binary' class struggle in Marx. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> 'Dictatorship  of the proleteriat': Race to bottom of wages. The fact that we <span class='centered'>assume that all the evil could be attributed to the bourgouise itself <span class='centered'>setup the seeds for revolution. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> How will the replacement of the bourgouise happen? Why wouldn't the proleteriat <span class='centered'>become as or more corrupt than the capitalists? </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> What makes you believe that you can take a complicated system like the free <span class='centered'>market and then centralize this? </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> A capitalist who is running a business as a manager does add value. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> The criticism of profit. What's wrong with profit? Profit is theft is the <span class='centered'>marxist principle. If the capitalist adds value to the corporation, then they <span class='centered'>do deserve profit. Profit sets a constraint on wasted labour. There are forms <span class='centered'>of stupidity you cannot engage in because the market will punish you for it. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> 'The dictatorship of the proleteriat' would become hyper-productive. How? <span class='centered'>The theory seems to be that once we eradicate the profit motive and the <span class='centered'>bourgouise allows them to become hyper productive. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> We need hyper productivity for the dictatorship of the proleteriat to create <span class='centered'>enough goods for everyone. When this happens, everyone will engage in meaningful <span class='centered'>creative labour, which they had been alienated from in capitalism. Then this <span class='centered'>will create a utopia. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Does this utopia really be the right utopia for everyone? </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> The Dostovyeskian observation: what shallow take on people do you need to believe <span class='centered'>that if you hand people everything they need, they'll be happy? We were built <span class='centered'>for trouble. Hanging out on the beach is a vacation, not a job. We would <span class='centered'>destroy things just so something can happen just so we can have the adventure <span class='centered'>of our lives. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Marx and Engels admit that there has not been a system that's capable to produce <span class='centered'>materials in excess as capitalism. </li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>Zizek: 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> The irony of how Petersen and him are both marginalized by the academic <span class='centered'>community. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> China today: strong authoritarian state, wild capitalist dynamics. It's managed <span class='centered'>to uplift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. They want the <span class='centered'>Cofuscian ideal of harmonious society. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Happiness as goal of life is problematic. Humans are creative in sabotaging <span class='centered'>pursuit of happiness. We have to find a meaningful cause beyond the mere <span class='centered'>struggle for pleasurable survival. Modernity means that we should carry the <span class='centered'>burden of freedom of choice. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Never presume that your sufferring is in itself a proof of authenticity. <span class='centered'>Renunciation of pleasure can turn into the pleasure of renunciation. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  </li></ul>
