    "## Parametrized differentiable curve\n",
    "Let $\\alpha: (a, b) \\to \\mathbb R$. Then $\\alpha$ is a **parametrized differentiable curve** iff $\\alpha$ is differentiable in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tangent line\n",
    "- Let $\\alpha: (a, b) \\to \\mathbb R$.\n",
    "- For each $t \\in I$ such that $\\alpha'(t) \\neq 0$, there is a unique straight line which contains the point $\\alpha(t)$ and the vector $\\alpha'(t)$. This line is the tangent line to $\\alpha$ at $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular curve\n",
    "- A parametrized differentiable curve $\\alpha: I \\to \\mathbb R$ is said to be **regular** iff $\\alpha'(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\in I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arc length\n",
    "- Given $t \\in I$, the arc length from the point $t_0$ is defined to be:\n",

    "- If the parameter $t$ is already the arclength measured from some basepoint $t_0$, then $ds/dt = ds/ds = 1 = |\\alpha'(t)|$. So the velocity vector has length 1.\n",
    "- On the other hand, if $|\\alpha'(t)| = 1$, then $s(t) = \\int_{t_0}^t |\\alpha'(t)| dt = \\int_{t_0}^t 1 dt = t - t_0$. That is, $t$ is the arc-length measured from some point.\n",
    "- This means that we have an equivalence: $|\\alpha'(t)| = 1$ iff $\\alpha$ is arc-length parametrized.\n",
    "- We shall restrict ourselves to arclength-parametrized curves, since we can alwas reparametrize curves to be arclength parametrized (TODO: why? Section 1.5)\n",

    "- This is an equivalence relation on the set of ordered bases of $V$\n",
    "- If we choose some \"basepoint\" orientation $\\{ b_i \\}$, we get two equivalence classes, one with the same orientation as $b_i$, and one with the opposite one. \n",
    "- There is a natural orientation given by setting $\\{ (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) \\}$ to have orientation $+1$.\n",

    "- Let $u, v \\in \\mathbb R^3$. The vector product/wedge product of $u, v$ (in that order) is defined by the relation $(u \\wedge v) \\cdot w) = det(u, v, w)$ for all $w \\in \\mathbb R^3$.\n",

    "# Local theory of arclength parametrized curves\n",

    "- The plane containing $\\alpha'(s)$ and $\\alpha''(s)$ is the osculating plane at $s$.\n",

    "- Points where $\\alpha'(s) = 0$ are singular points of order $0$.\n",
