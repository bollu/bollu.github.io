 <span class='centered'>I recently binged a lot of Lovecraftian horror to get a sense of 
 <span class='centered'>his writing style. Here's a big list of my favourite quotes:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most <span class='centered'> exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have <span class='centered'> made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and <span class='centered'> grotesque forms. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> seething vortex of time </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Snatches of what I read and wrote would linger in my memory. There were <span class='centered'> horrible annals of other worlds and other universes, and of stirrings of <span class='centered'> formless life outside of all universes </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horror-filled <span class='centered'> core, before the utter end. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> appalled at the measureless age of the fragments </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> fitted darkly into certain Papuan and Polynesian legends of infinite <span class='centered'> antiquity </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles <span class='centered'> of time and geologic upheavals of cosmic savagery. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> uttermost horrors of the aeon-old legendry </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The moon, slightly past full, shone from a clear sky, and drenched the <span class='centered'> ancient sands with a white, leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow <span class='centered'> infinitely evil. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> with the bloated, fungoid moon sinking in the west </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> how preserved through aeons of geologic convulsion I could not then <span class='centered'> and cannot now even attempt to guess. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> gently bred families of the town </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by <span class='centered'> sly, staring eyes that never shut. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> and there was that constant, terrifying impression of other sounds--perhaps <span class='centered'> from regions beyond life--trembling on the very brink of audibility. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> little garden oasis of village-like antiquity where huge, friendly cats <span class='centered'> sunned themselves atop a convenient shed. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Better it be left alone for the years to topple, lest things be stirred that ought to rest forevrr in the black abyss </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> It clearly belonged to some settled technique of infinite maturity and <span class='centered'> perfection, yet that technique was utterly remote from any--Eastern or <span class='centered'> Western, ancient or modern--which I had ever heard of or seen exemplified. It <span class='centered'> was as if the workmanship were that of another planet. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> never was an organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that <span class='centered'> transcends form and force and symmetry. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> away outside the galaxy and possibly beyond the last curved rim of <span class='centered'> space. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> It was like the drone of some loathsome, gigantic insect ponderously shaped <span class='centered'> into the articulate speech of an alien species </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> In time the ruts of custom and economic interest became so deeply cut in <span class='centered'> approved places that there was no longer any reason for going outside them, <span class='centered'> and the haunted hills were left deserted by accident rather than by design </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> There were, too, certain caves of problematical depth in the sides of the <span class='centered'> hills; with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcely accidental, and <span class='centered'> with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward and <span class='centered'> away from them </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> he fortified himself with the mass lore of cryptography </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> As before, the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the <span class='centered'> blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed <span class='centered'> him from an object to a subject of fear </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily <span class='centered'> insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless <span class='centered'> message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying <span class='centered'> man </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous <span class='centered'> threats to the peace and sanity of the world </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic <span class='centered'> geometry unknown to earth or the solar system </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> I do not believe I would like to visit that country by night--at least not when the sinister stars are out </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> there was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical properties, <span class='centered'> and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced by <span class='centered'> the unknown.. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest bites induced a lasting disgust </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'>  everywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, <span class='centered'>  underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth. <span class='centered'><span class='centered'> In her raving there was not a single specific noun, but only verbs and <span class='centered'> pronouns.. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with a studied malevolence </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> There are things which cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common <span class='centered'> humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed <span class='centered'> fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh, </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> No traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines, and <span class='centered'> artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the <span class='centered'> spirits as of the eye. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, <span class='centered'> and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in <span class='centered'> its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing <span class='centered'> together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of <span class='centered'> reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad <span class='centered'> from the revelation... </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> form which only a diseased fancy could conceive </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> ... dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or <span class='centered'> garden-girdled Babylon </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or <span class='centered'> mineralogy. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> miserable huddle of hut </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men <span class='centered'> as they ploughed on through the black morass. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. </blockquote>
