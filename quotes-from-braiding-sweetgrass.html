 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Listening in wild places, we are audience to conversations in a language not <span class='centered'> our own </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Puhpowee,  she explained, translates as “the force which causes mushrooms to <span class='centered'> push up from the earth overnight.” As a biologist, I was stunned that such a <span class='centered'> word existed. In all its technical vocabulary, Western science has no such <span class='centered'> term, no words to hold this mystery. You’d think that biologists, of all <span class='centered'> people, would have words for life. But in scientific language our terminology <span class='centered'> is used to define the boundaries of our knowing. What lies beyond our grasp <span class='centered'> remains unnamed. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Only 30 percent of English words are verbs, but in Potawatomi that proportion <span class='centered'> is 70 percent. Which means that 70 percent of the words have to be <span class='centered'> conjugated, and 70 percent have different tenses and cases to be mastered.. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Our toddlers speak of plants and animals as if they were people, extending to <span class='centered'> them self and intention and compassion—until we teach them not to. We quickly <span class='centered'> retrain them and make them forget. When we tell them that the tree is not a <span class='centered'> who,  but an  it,  we make that maple an object;  </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> We don’t know their names or their faces, but our fingers rest right where <span class='centered'> theirs had been and we know what they too were doing one morning in April <span class='centered'> long ago. And we know what they had on their pancakes. Our stories are linked <span class='centered'> in this run of sap; our trees knew them as they know us today.. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> I realize that those first homesteaders were not the beneficiaries of that <span class='centered'> shade, at least not as a young couple. They must have meant for their people <span class='centered'> to stay here. Surely those two were sleeping up on Cemetery Road long before <span class='centered'> the shade arched across the road. I am living today in the shady future they <span class='centered'> imagined, drinking sap from trees planted with their wedding vows. They could <span class='centered'> not have imagined me, many generations later, and yet I live in the gift of <span class='centered'> their care. Could they have imagined that when my daughter Linden was <span class='centered'> married, she would choose leaves of maple sugar for the wedding giveaway? </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> You should not be able to walk on a pond. It should be an invitation to <span class='centered'> wildlife, not a snare. The likelihood of making the pond swimmable, even for <span class='centered'> geese, seemed remote at best. But I am an ecologist, so I was confident that <span class='centered'> I could at least improve the situation. The word  ecology  is derived from <span class='centered'> the Greek  oikos,  the word for home. I could use ecology to make a good home <span class='centered'> for goslings and girls. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Our appetite for their fruits leads us to till, prune, irrigate, fertilize, <span class='centered'> and weed on their behalf. Perhaps they have domesticated us. Wild plants have <span class='centered'> changed to stand in well-behaved rows and wild humans have changed to settle <span class='centered'> alongside the fields and care for the plants—a kind of mutual taming. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> In that awareness, looking over the objects on my desk—the basket, the <span class='centered'> candle, the paper—I delight in following their origins back to the ground. I <span class='centered'> twirl a pencil—a magic wand lathed from incense cedar— between my fingers. <span class='centered'> The willow bark in the aspirin. Even the metal of my lamp asks me to consider <span class='centered'> its roots in the strata of the earth. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> I smile when I hear my colleagues say “I discovered X.” That’s kind of like <span class='centered'> Columbus claiming to have discovered America. It was here all along, it’s <span class='centered'> just that he didn’t know it. Experiments are not about discovery but about <span class='centered'> listening and translating the knowledge of other beings. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> It seems counterintuitive, but when a herd of buffalo grazes down a sward of <span class='centered'> fresh grass, it actually grows faster in response. This helps the plant <span class='centered'> recover, but also invites the buffalo back for dinner later in the season. <span class='centered'> It’s even been discovered that there is an enzyme in the saliva of grazing <span class='centered'> buffalo that actually stimulates grass growth. To say nothing of the <span class='centered'> fertilizer produced by a passing herd. Grass gives to buffalo and buffalo <span class='centered'> give to grass. </blockquote>
