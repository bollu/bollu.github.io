# Disks

- bits are stored -> tracks.
- organised into tracks, which occupy most of surface.
- tracks -> sectors: segments of the circle separated by gaps.
- sector is indivisible for read/write.
- gaps are ~10% of track, identify beginning of sector.
- sector is physical, block is LOGICAL
- tracks under the head at the same time form a cylinder.

- latency: time taken b/w read is issued versus contents appear in memory.
- seek time: time to position head of cylinder at right position
- time to rotate so that first of sector containing block reaches the head:
  rotational latency
- disk rotates at 3840 RPM
- take 1ms to start and stop, plus 1 ms for every 500 cylinders travelled.
  on avg, 1.002. Goes from innermost -> outermost track (8192 sectors)
  in 17.4 ms

# multi way merge

1. The block size is B bytes.
2. The main memory available for buffering blocks is M bytes.
3. Records take R bytes.

- number of blocks storable in memory: M / B
- in second phase, all but one of M/B is devoted to blocks. 1 is devoted to output sublist.
- so number of sorted sublists that will be created is M/B - 1
- Each till we fill up main memory, we sort M/R records (wat?)
- total number of records we can sort is M/R(M/B - 1) = M^2/RB
