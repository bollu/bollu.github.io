\chapter{Diagonalization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Level 1: $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
    \item Level 2: $\exists L, L \notin \texttt{RE}$.
    \item Level 3: Halting problem is undecidable.
    \item Level 4: Time/Space hierarchy. 
    \item Limitations: Exists oracles A,  B such that --- $P^A = {NP}^A, P^B \neq {NP}^B$
    \item Level 5: If $P \neq NP$, $\exists L, L \notin P, L \notin NPC$ (Ladner's theorem)
\end{itemize}

Diagonalization cannot separate P, NP ---
If it could, then it should also separate P with any oracle, and NP with the
same oracle.  We know that there exists an oracle such that we can separate 
$P^A = NP^A$, as well as $P^B \neq NP^B$.
