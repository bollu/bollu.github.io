\chapter{Property testing}

We have some language $L \subset \{0, 1\}^*$. We need to decide if $x \in_? L$
by only querying a \textit{fixed number of query locations} in $x$.
the query number $q$ is fixed and is \textit{independent} of $n$.


\section{\parity}

$$\parity \equiv \{ x \in \{0, 1\}^*~|~ \text{$\#1$s in $x$ is even} \}$$

parity cannot be done by querying an independent number of locations, since
intuitively, an adversary can flip bits at locations that have not been read by
us.

\section{\majority}


$$
\majority \equiv \{x \in \{0, 1\}^*~|~ \text{$\#1$s in $x$ is $\geq n/2$} \}
$$

This is also not possible to be solved, because the adversary can flip bits
of a string where $\#1's = n / 2$.

\section{Approximate decision problems}

$x \in L$ versus $x$ which is $\epsilon$-far from $L$. ($x$ is $\epsilon$-far
from $L$ if there exists no string in $L$ with hamming distance less than
$\epsilon$ in L).

\subsection{\partity, approximate}
$\#1's \geq n/2$, then accept. $\#1's \leq n/4$, then reject.
