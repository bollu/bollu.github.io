# Game design
using markdown since I doubt I'll be taking "serious notes" for this subject.

# Class 4: Mechanics 1, 2, 3

- Rule, Play, culture
## Mechanic 1: Space
- Discrete / continuous

## Mechanic 2: Objects, Attributes, States
- Objects, properties, and relationships.

# Class 5: Mechanic 4: Rules & Mechanic 5: Skill
- Rules are the most fundamental mechanic. Define the goals, the space,
    the object, the actions.

### Classification of rules
- Constituative: abstract, mathematical rules of the game. (formal structure)
- Operational: rules of play that guide the game. "what players do"
- Implicit: rules that are appreciated by players, but not present in the book.
    ("good sportsmanship") eg. do not tickle the other player when playing
    chess.

- operational v/s constituative: operational may say "roll a dice and place n
     power tokens where n is the roll of the dice". Constituative would say
       "increase player power by a uniform random number from 1 through 6"
       
### Mechanic 5: Skill
- Physical and mental skill
- social skill
- real v/s virtual skill

### Balance
- Fairness
- Challenge
- Meaningul choice: risk vs/reward of choices should be proportional
- competition v/s co-operation: Joust is an example where the balance is shown.
  Can play competitively to achieve more points than co-op player. Must play
  "true co-op" co-op to achieve highest absolute points.

### Concealed rules
- Eleusis: one player chooses a secret rule, players attempt to discover the
  rule.
-Penultima: game of inductive logic played on chess board. 

### Complex games
- Mage knight:
- Third reich:
- World in flames:
  

# Class 6: FORMS OF INTERACTION

## Persuasive games
- games that can help people learn skills
    - Intruguing objective
    - Real-life meaning
    - Strong message
    - Powerful visuals
    - Uncertainty

## Objectives
- Capture
- Chase
- Race to the goal / race against the clock
- Align pieces
- Forbidden act: force opponent to make the wrong move
- Construction
- Outwitting

## How are players organized against the game?
- PVE (single-player)
- PVP (multiplayer, 1v1)
- PPPVP (team against one)
- PVPVP (free for all)
- PPPVPPP (team aginst team)
- PPPVE (co-op)


# Class 7:  Mechanic 5 - Skill:  Introducing complexity


## Meaningful Play
- We need complexity as a pre-requisite for meaningful play.
- A complex system "cannot be too orderly".
- Fixed < Periodic < Complex < Chaotic
- Meaning resides in the [action -> outcome] of a game.
- In the heads/tails game, it's meaningless since player action has no control on outcome.
- BS about emergence, cellular automata, game of life, Langton's ant, etc.

## Emergence from game story

-  linear (mario)
- non-linear branching (zero-escape)
- non-linear (deus ex)
- detour (mass effect)

## Chance

- If you roll a dice 4 times, what is the probability at least once we will get
  6? Total no. of combinations = 6^4. Number of unfavourable combinations =
  5^4.
- (6^4 - 5^4) / 6^4 > 0.5

## Using chance in a game
- People are conservative in taking risks for gains.
- When people are faced with small certain loss and large probable loss,
  they will gamble.

## Chance & Skill
- Estimating chance is a skill.
- Estimating an opponents skill is a skill
