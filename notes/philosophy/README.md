2. What role does temporality and spatiality play in the problem of personal
   identity? Discuss.

3. Does Strawson succeed in overcoming the impasse between the ‘moral optimist’
   and ‘pessimist’? Discuss

4. Critically evaluate Strawson’s conception of reactive attitudes with respect
   to Kantian moral theory.

5. What further consequences follow from the ‘phenomenological’ or ‘bottom up’
