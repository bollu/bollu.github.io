</p><h3><a name="basic">The basic Bresenham algorithm</a></h3>

Consider drawing a line on a raster grid where we restrict the
allowable slopes of the line to the range <img src="line-drawing_files/slopelt1.gif">.<p>

If we further restrict the line-drawing routine so that it always
increments <em>x</em> as it plots, it becomes clear that, having
plotted a point at <em>(x,y)</em>, the routine has a severely limited
range of options as to where it may put the <em>next</em> point on the
line:</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> It may plot the point <em>(x+1,y)</em>, or:
</li><li> It may plot the point <em>(x+1,y+1)</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>

So, working in the <em>first positive octant</em> of the plane, line
drawing becomes a matter of deciding between two possibilities at each
step.</p><p>

We can draw a diagram of the situation which the plotting program finds
itself in having plotted <em>(x,y)</em>.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/bres1.gif"></center><p>

In plotting <em>(x,y)</em> the line drawing routine will, in general,
be making a compromise between what it would like to draw and what the
resolution of the screen actually allows it to draw. Usually the
plotted point <em>(x,y)</em> will be in error, the actual, mathematical
point on the line will not be addressable on the pixel grid. So we
associate an error, <img src="line-drawing_files/eps.gif">, with each <em>y</em> ordinate, 
the real value of <em>y</em> should be <img src="line-drawing_files/y_eps.gif">. This 
error will range from -0.5 to just under +0.5.</p><p>

In moving from <em>x</em> to <em>x+1</em> we increase the value of the
true (mathematical) y-ordinate by an amount equal to the slope of the
line, <em>m</em>. We will choose to plot <em>(x+1,y)</em> if the
difference between this new value and <em>y</em> is less than 0.5.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/yemlty5.gif"></center><p>

Otherwise we will plot <em>(x+1,y+1)</em>. It should be clear that by
so doing we minimise the total error between the mathematical line
segment and what actually gets drawn on the display.</p><p>

The error resulting from this new point can now be written back into
<img src="line-drawing_files/eps.gif">, this will allow us to repeat the whole process for
the next point along the line, at <em>x+2</em>.</p><p>

The new value of error can adopt one of two possible values, depending
on what new point is plotted. If <em>(x+1,y)</em> is chosen, the new
value of error is given by:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/epsnew1.gif"></center><p>

Otherwise it is:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/epsnew2.gif"></center><p>

This gives an algorithm for a DDA which avoids rounding operations,
instead using the error variable <img src="line-drawing_files/eps.gif"> to control plotting:
</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/pseudo1.gif"></center><p>

This still employs floating point values. Consider, however, what
happens if we multiply across both sides of the plotting test by
<img src="line-drawing_files/dx.gif"> and then by 2:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/derive1.gif"></center><p>

All quantities in this inequality are now integral.</p><p>

Substitute <img src="line-drawing_files/epsprime.gif"> for <img src="line-drawing_files/epsdx.gif">. The test
becomes:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/test1.gif"></center><p>

This gives an <em>integer-only</em> test for deciding which point to
plot.</p><p>

The update rules for the error on each step may also be cast into <img src="line-drawing_files/epsprime.gif"> form. Consider the floating-point versions of the
update rules:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/update1.gif"></center><p>

Multiplying through by <img src="line-drawing_files/dx.gif"> yields:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/update2.gif"></center><p>

which is in <img src="line-drawing_files/epsprime.gif"> form.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/update3.gif"></center><p>

Using this new ``error'' value, <img src="line-drawing_files/epsprime.gif">, with the new test and
update equations gives Bresenham's integer-only line drawing algorithm:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/pseudo2.gif"></center><p>

</p><ul>
<li> Integer only - hence efficient (fast).
</li><li> Multiplication by 2 can be implemented by left-shift.
</li><li> This version limited to slopes in the first octant, <img src="line-drawing_files/slopelt1.gif">.
</li></ul><p>

Here is a C++ implementation of the Bresenham algorithm for line
segments in the first octant.</p><p>

</p><pre>    void linev6(Screen &amp;s,
              unsigned x1, unsigned y1,
              unsigned x2, unsigned y2,
              unsigned char colour )
    {
      int dx  = x2 - x1,
          dy  = y2 - y1,
          y   = y1,
          eps = 0;
    
      for ( int x = x1; x &lt;= x2; x++ )  {
        s.Plot(x,y,colour);
        eps += dy;
        if ( (eps &lt;&lt; 1) &gt;= dx )  {
          y++;  eps -= dx;
        }
      }
    }
</pre>

This is an all-integer function, employs left shift for multiplication
and eliminates redundant operations by tricky use of the
<code>eps</code> variable.<p>

This implementation of Bresenham's algorithm is incomplete, it does not
check the validity of its arguments. A real implementation should do
this.

In fact, a real implementation of Bresenham's algorithm should do more
than simply reject lines with slopes lying outside the first octant, 
it should handle lines of arbitrary slope.</p><p>

</p><hr><p>
</p><h3><a name="slopes">Handling multiple slopes</a></h3>

If we try out the C++ implementation of the Bresenham algorithm, we
find it has some peculiar properties.<p>

As expected, it fails to plot lines with negative slopes (try it and
see what happens). It also fails to plot lines of positive slope
greater than 1 (this is an interesting case, try it also and see if you
can explain what is happening).</p><p>

More unusually, we find that the order in which the endpoints are supplied 
to this routine is significant, it will only work as long as <code>x1</code>
is smaller than <code>x2</code>.</p><p>

In fact, if we have two line segments with the same endpoints, and the
same slope, this routine may draw one of them successfully but fails to
draw the other one.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/lsdlfp.gif"></center><p>

Of course, this is not surprising really, when we consider that the
function works by <strong>incrementing</strong> <em>x</em>. It does
emphasise, however, that the routine is plotting <em>vectors</em>,
direction is significant. Considering all the vectors from
<em>(x1,y1)</em> to <em>(x2,y2)</em> we find that there are eight
regions, (the ``octants'') and the basic Bresenham algorithm works in
only one of them.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/octants.gif"></center><p>

A full implementation of the Bresenham algorithm must, of course, be able 
to handle all combinations of slope and endpoint order.</p><p>

Some of the regions in the plane, those for which <em>x2</em> is
smaller than <em>x1</em> can be handled by exchanging the endpoints of the
line segment.</p><p>

It is also clear that we will need a piece of code to handle large
slopes by stepping over <em>y</em> instead of <em>x</em> values.</p><p>

However, careful consideration of the diagram will reveal that there is
one case which cannot be reduced to a version of the algorithm we have
already looked at. If we want to draw a line having a small 
<em>negative</em> slope, we will have to consider a modification of the 
basic Bresenham algorithm to do this. (The same point applies to lines of
<em>large</em> negative slope as well, but the code for small negative
slopes may be adapted to this case by stepping over <em>y</em> instead
of <em>x</em>).</p><p> 

</p><hr><p>
</p><h3><a name="basic">Bresenham for negative slopes</a></h3>

<center><img src="line-drawing_files/bres2.gif"></center><p>

Consider a line with negative slope between 0 and 1 (i.e., small
negative slope. Given that a line-drawing algorithm has plotted a point
at <em>(x,y)</em>, its choice about where to plot the next point is 
between <em>(x+1,y-1)</em> and <em>(x+1,y)</em>.</p><p>

As usual there will be an error, <img src="line-drawing_files/eps.gif">, associated with
<em>y</em>. Choice of the next point to plot will be based on an
attempt to minimise error, so plot <em>(x+1,y)</em> if:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/yyemlt5.gif"></center><p>

Otherwise plot <em>(x+1,y-1)</em>. Notice that the error generated by
the above is <em>negative</em>. A little manipulation gives a decision 
inequality:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/emgt5.gif"></center><p>

It is worth comparing this with the decision inequality for the case of
positive slope.</p><p>

The error update rules are also subtly different for this case of
negative slope.</p><p>

If plotting <em>(x+1,y)</em> the <em>new</em> value of error is given
by:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/epsnew3.gif"></center><p>

Otherwise, plotting <em>(x+1,y-1)</em> gives new error:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/epsnew4.gif"></center><p>

A pseudocode algorithm for this routine may be written as:

</p><center><img src="line-drawing_files/pseudo3.gif"></center><p>

This is cast in terms of floating-point values.. It is, however, a
trivial matter to convert the algorithm into an integer-only form.</p><p>
