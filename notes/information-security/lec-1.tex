\subsection{Impossiblity of Infosec problems}
Common aspect across all infosec problems to date is that it is
impossible to solve.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Password schemes - It is impossible to design a good password scheme.
          The machine must know something about the password you need to give.
          Call it the password file (TODO: how to do monospace?)
    \item Password Length - everlasting is impossible. One can always brute
        force passwords. Infinite length passwords do not work.
    \item  Secure communication over insecure channels
    \item Signing
    \item  Digital cash
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Secure communication over insecure channels}
\begin{listing}
sender ---> key ---> receiver
            |
            v
            adversary
\end{listing}

At time t0, everything that receiver knows, adversary knows (assuming no
one-time pad). After that, everything the receiver receives, the adversary
also knows as well. So, the adversary has all information that the receiver
does.

It is impossible to do secure communication over insecure channels.

\subsubsection{Signing}
Digital signature is impossible - Unforgable digital signature should not exist.


1. Signature should be a function of the message for it to be useful as a signature.
   Otherwise, an attacker could intersect messages to find the signature.
2. Signature must be publically verifiable.
3. A trapdoor function can be reverse-engineered.

\subsubsection{Digital cash}
How do we detect counterfeit cash? Double spending is a problem. Cryptocurrencies
used the exact same mathematical methods that are shared across crypto. 

\subsection{A Tom and Jerry analogy}
Tom \& Spike are both Jerry's opponents. So, Jerry is able to play Tom and spike
against each other, and have them beat each other. 

That is, pair adversaries against each other to have them screw with each other.

\subsubsection{Password schemes, take 2}
We needed infinite length passwords because an adversary will win if we have finite
length password. However, there are other adversaries. For example, the adversary
for algorithms is the person who provides inputs. Example, think of sorting networks
or uses of bubble sort: Sorting networks are useful on small numbers of elements
to sort. Bubble sort does not screw with cache coherence. However, these are both
bad solutions *in general*.
 
When the worst case input giver is an adversary, and a person who is trying to
crack our password is an adversary, we can have these two interfere.

To find out `y = f(x)`, we wind up using the algorithmic adversary who
provides hard problems for `f`.


Structure of information matters. Example, linked list v/s balanced tree. The
process of decryption can exploit structure of information.


eg: Natural number can be represented as a product of primes, and in the
decimal notation.


\subsubsection{Active adversary / noise}

We cannot design error detection codes for any amount of error. Hence, if
we think of adversary as error in the stream, we can think of secure communication
on a channel with an active adversary as ECC.

So now, this problem is now an information theory problem. 

The adversary must make a modification such that the bank cannot detect it.
Coding theory tells us that such a modification is always possible. Infosec
tells us that we can design schemes where this takes a long time.
