<ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> my only other critique, =which is good in general, but try to force yourself to speak slower than you want to</li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> taking time to build a diagram is the best way to convey knowledge</li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> learning to be comfortable with silences while speaking doesn't come naturally to anyone</li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Some kids grow up on football. I grew up on public speaking (as behavioral<span class='centered'>therapy for a speech impediment, actually). If you want to get radically<span class='centered'>better in a hurry: 1) If you ever find yourself buffering on output, rather<span class='centered'>than making hesitation noises, just pause. People will read that as<span class='centered'>considered deliberation and intelligence. It's outrageously more effective<span class='centered'>than the equivalent amount of emm, aww, like, etc. Practice saying nothing.<span class='centered'>Nothing is often the best possible thing to say. (A great time to say<span class='centered'>nothing: during applause or laughter.) 2) People remember voice a heck of a<span class='centered'>lot more than they remember content. Not vocal voice, but your authorial<span class='centered'>voice, the sort of thing English teachers teach you to detect in written<span class='centered'>documents. After you have found a voice which works for you and your typical<span class='centered'>audiences, you can exploit it to the hilt.  I have basically one way to start<span class='centered'>speeches: with a self-deprecating joke. It almost always gets a laugh out of<span class='centered'>the crowd, and I can't be nervous when people are laughing with me, so that<span class='centered'>helps break the ice and warm us into the main topic.  3) Posture hacks: if<span class='centered'>you're addressing any group of people larger than a dinner table, pick three<span class='centered'>people in the left, middle, and right of the crowd. Those three people are<span class='centered'>your new best friends, who have come to hear you talk but for some strange<span class='centered'>reason are surrounded by great masses of mammals who are uninvolved in the<span class='centered'>speech. Funny that. Rotate eye contact over your three best friends as you<span class='centered'>talk, at whatever a natural pace would be for you. (If you don't know what a<span class='centered'>natural pace is, two sentences or so works for me to a first approximation.)<span class='centered'>Everyone in the audience -- both your friends and the uninvolved mammals --<span class='centered'>will perceive that you are looking directly at them for enough of the speech<span class='centered'>to feel flattered but not quite enough to feel creepy.  4) Podiums were<span class='centered'>invented by some sadist who hates introverts. Don't give him the<span class='centered'>satisfaction. Speak from a vantage point where the crowd can see your entire<span class='centered'>body.  5) Hands: pockets, no, pens, no, fidgeting, no. Gestures, yes. If you<span class='centered'>don't have enough gross motor control to talk and gesture at the same time<span class='centered'>(no joke, this was once a problem for me) then having them in a neutral<span class='centered'>position in front of your body works well.  6) Many people have different<span class='centered'>thoughts on the level of preparation or memorization which is required. In<span class='centered'>general, having strong control of the narrative structure of your speech<span class='centered'>without being wedded to the exact ordering of sentences is a good balance for<span class='centered'>most people. (The fact that you're coming to the conclusion shouldn't<span class='centered'>surprise you.) 7) If you remember nothing else on microtactical phrasing when<span class='centered'>you're up there, remember that most people do not naturally include enough<span class='centered'>transition words when speaking informally, which tends to make speeches loose<span class='centered'>narrative cohesion. Throw in a few more than you would ordinarily think to<span class='centered'>do. ("Another example of this...", "This is why...", "Furthermore...", etc etc.)</li></ul>
