 <span class='centered'>my only other critique, =which is good in general, but try to force yourself to 
 <span class='centered'>speak slower than you want to.  
 <span class='centered'>taking time to build a diagram is the best way to convey knowledge  
 <span class='centered'>learning to be comfortable with silences while speaking doesn't come naturally to anyone.  
 <span class='centered'>Some kids grow up on football. I grew up on public speaking (as behavioral 
 <span class='centered'>therapy for a speech impediment, actually). If you want to get radically better 
 <span class='centered'>in a hurry: 1) If you ever find yourself buffering on output, rather than 
 <span class='centered'>making hesitation noises, just pause. People will read that as considered 
 <span class='centered'>deliberation and intelligence. It's outrageously more effective than the 
 <span class='centered'>equivalent amount of emm, aww, like, etc. Practice saying nothing.  Nothing is 
 <span class='centered'>often the best possible thing to say. (A great time to say nothing: during 
 <span class='centered'>applause or laughter.) 2) People remember voice a heck of a lot more than they 
 <span class='centered'>remember content. Not vocal voice, but your authorial voice, the sort of thing 
 <span class='centered'>English teachers teach you to detect in written documents. After you have found 
 <span class='centered'>a voice which works for you and your typical audiences, you can exploit it to 
 <span class='centered'>the hilt.  I have basically one way to start speeches: with a self-deprecating 
 <span class='centered'>joke. It almost always gets a laugh out of the crowd, and I can't be nervous 
 <span class='centered'>when people are laughing with me, so that helps break the ice and warm us into 
 <span class='centered'>the main topic.  3) Posture hacks: if you're addressing any group of people 
 <span class='centered'>larger than a dinner table, pick three people in the left, middle, and right of 
 <span class='centered'>the crowd. Those three people are your new best friends, who have come to hear 
 <span class='centered'>you talk but for some strange reason are surrounded by great masses of mammals 
 <span class='centered'>who are uninvolved in the speech. Funny that. Rotate eye contact over your 
 <span class='centered'>three best friends as you talk, at whatever a natural pace would be for you. 
 <span class='centered'>(If you don't know what a natural pace is, two sentences or so works for me to 
 <span class='centered'>a first approximation.) Everyone in the audience -- both your friends and the 
 <span class='centered'>uninvolved mammals -- will perceive that you are looking directly at them for 
 <span class='centered'>enough of the speech to feel flattered but not quite enough to feel creepy.  4) 
 <span class='centered'>Podiums were invented by some sadist who hates introverts. Don't give him the 
 <span class='centered'>satisfaction. Speak from a vantage point where the crowd can see your entire 
 <span class='centered'>body.  5) Hands: pockets, no, pens, no, fidgeting, no. Gestures, yes. If you 
 <span class='centered'>don't have enough gross motor control to talk and gesture at the same time (no 
 <span class='centered'>joke, this was once a problem for me) then having them in a neutral position in 
 <span class='centered'>front of your body works well.  6) Many people have different thoughts on the 
 <span class='centered'>level of preparation or memorization which is required. In general, having 
 <span class='centered'>strong control of the narrative structure of your speech without being wedded 
 <span class='centered'>to the exact ordering of sentences is a good balance for most people. (The fact 
 <span class='centered'>that you're coming to the conclusion shouldn't surprise you.) 7) If you 
 <span class='centered'>remember nothing else on microtactical phrasing when you're up there, remember 
 <span class='centered'>that most people do not naturally include enough transition words when speaking 
 <span class='centered'>informally, which tends to make speeches loose narrative cohesion. Throw in a 
 <span class='centered'>few more than you would ordinarily think to do. ("Another example of this...", 
 <span class='centered'>"This is why...", "Furthermore...", etc etc.).  
 <span class='centered'>Use  <code class='inline'>for little c in big C</code> to say things like  <code class='inline'>for c ∈ C</code>
