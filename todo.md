- "You just pick the speed of light squared in Minkowski space to be an
  appropriate algebraic number, and magic happens! Suddenly solutions of
  natural PDE's on hyperbolic manifolds are linked with cohomology of
  arithmetic groups." I picked it up from a variety of sources, but I'd
  recommend reading anything by Alan Reid. He has some course notes floating
  around which cover arbitrary hyperbolic n-manifolds, though I can't seem to
  track them down at the moment.  People often focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds
  because there are some very strong links to number theory (e.g. Spec(Z)
  behaves like a 3-manifold in certain ways), but the machinery works for
  higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds as well. "Arithmetic hyperbolic
  manifolds" is a good keyword to look for if you want to dig deeper.

- Take birkhoff polytope; is a polytope, can build discrete diff geo
  around it. consider tangent spaces. now perform DHMC on this space?
  Problem is that the "interesting" points are vertices, so we may
  not gain much. However, what happens if we tesselate the space 
  with birkhoff polytopes? Perhaps likely we get something? it's
  unclear, but very interesting for sure.

  sparse form is tree, in dense form is some dense repr. `complete a = leaf a | branch (complete a) (complete a)`
  is tree in sparse form, heap in dense form.
