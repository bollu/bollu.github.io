> constant empathetic tactile contact required to produce a sophisticated type of
> preverbal communication is rare--except among preconquest peoples.
> Eliciting delight from babies was a desired social norm, and attentive tactile
> stimulation was the daily lot of infants. It included protracted body-to-body
> caressing, snuggling, oral sensuality, hugging, fondling, and kissing. The
> seductive aspect of the play was frequently collective as older children singly
> or in combination used their inventive wiles to delight a baby. In their

- Example of left-inverse that is not a right inverse: `parse` and `print`.
  `parse(print(e)) = e` can be achieved easily by printing into a legal parseable format.
   On the other hand, `print(parse(s)) = s` is much harder, since for example,
   `print(parse("1+2")) = "1 + 2"`, while `"1+2" != "1 + 2"`.
- Pollack-inconsistency:To make these issues concrete we introduce the notion
   of Pollack-consistency. This property is
  related to a system being able to correctly parse formulas that it printed
  itself. In current systems it happens regularly that this fails.  We argue that
  a good interactive theorem prover should be Pollack-consistent. We show with
  examples that many interactive theorem provers currently are not
  Pollack-consistent. Finally we describe a simple approach for making a system
  Pollack-consistent, which only consists of a small modification to the printing
  code of the system.

- The thing I find fascinating from a sociology perspective about ransomware is
  that they have to. To be a successful ransomware company, you have to
  simultaneously be: 1. Completely immoral enough to attack companies, hold
  their data ransom and potentially put them out of business and reveal the
  private details of thousands of people.  2. Create enough trust in the
  company you attacked that they believe you will give the data back once you
  pay them.  It is crazy that they are psychologically savvy enough to
  simultaneously attain those directly conflicting goals.  In a cynical telling
  this is how you start a government or any organization with a monopoly on
  violence, ala mafia. First you make it clear that you can cause damage, then
  you make it clear that tax payers are safe. The next step for ransomware
  companies is to offer cyber security services, whether you want them or not.
  We've hacked you. We fixed your crappy unpatched software, if you try to
  remove us you lose all your data, so now we're your cyber security partners.

- A key part of these productive ecosystems is jobs. If you want to learn how
  to build bridges, you do not set up schools to teach engineering, you fund
  the building of bridges, and people will figure out how to build them on the
  job, and the demand for civil engineers will pull students to study this and
  then universities will open up programs to cater to that demand. The jobs
  come first. Only 5% of China's population attends university, yet they are
  able to build all the infrastructure they need because they have a laser like
  attention to creating jobs. They will even build bridges for America, as long
  as Chinese workers get to make them. They will build a port for anyone who
  wants it, as long as Chinese workers are the ones building the port. The
  entire Belt and Road initiative is an attempt to import infrastructure jobs
  by sending workers all over the world to build infrastructure, as long as
  China gets to build it. They know that half these projects will default and
  not make any money, but what they get out of that is a skilled workforce, and
  with a skilled workforce they can do anything. They will let American
  companies set up factories in China as long as there is a knowledge transfer
  as part of the deal. That all their state owned enterprises are losing money
  is not important, the acquisition of skills and the creation of productive
  ecosystems is what matters. I wonder when the US will realize this.  Western
  economic thinking is focused on P&L, rule of law, etc, and assumes as an
  article of faith that in such an environment, productive ecosystems will just
  arise all on their own, like rats being created from piles of trash. It will
  just happen, because in the past it just happened. So we are focused on
  abstract principles, but what the last 30 years has shown us is productive
  ecosystems being destroyed right and left as production migrates over to
  Asia.
-  Adding sum types to the bidirectional system breaks this characterization:
   two terms equivalent up to (some) commuting conversions may both be typable.
   To fix this, one can try and find type theories in which the commuting
   conversions no longer preserve equality. By adding (abstract) effects to the
   language, terms that used to be equivalent can now be distinguished,
   ensuring that term equality once again coincides with semantic equality.
   This is the key idea embodied in what is variously called polarized type
   theory, focalization, or call-by-push-value.
- Damas–Milner type inference [Damas and Milner 1982] allows only prefix polymorphism. This is a
  nice way to describe the difference between `∀ a (∀ b, a -> b -> a)` versus
  `∀ a a -> (∀ b. b -> a)`. . This restriction is called prefix or prenex
  polymorphism.  In their terminology, types contain no quantifiers at all;
  only type schemes can have quantifiers (on the outside). Polymorphism can be
  introduced only on let expressions.

- Some kids grow up on football. I grew up on public speaking (as behavioral
  therapy for a speech impediment, actually). If you want to get radically
  better in a hurry: 1) If you ever find yourself buffering on output, rather
  than making hesitation noises, just pause. People will read that as
  considered deliberation and intelligence. It's outrageously more effective
  than the equivalent amount of emm, aww, like, etc. Practice saying nothing.
  Nothing is often the best possible thing to say. (A great time to say
  nothing: during applause or laughter.) 2) People remember voice a heck of a
  lot more than they remember content. Not vocal voice, but your authorial
  voice, the sort of thing English teachers teach you to detect in written
  documents. After you have found a voice which works for you and your typical
  audiences, you can exploit it to the hilt.  I have basically one way to start
  speeches: with a self-deprecating joke. It almost always gets a laugh out of
  the crowd, and I can't be nervous when people are laughing with me, so that
  helps break the ice and warm us into the main topic.  3) Posture hacks: if
  you're addressing any group of people larger than a dinner table, pick three
  people in the left, middle, and right of the crowd. Those three people are
  your new best friends, who have come to hear you talk but for some strange
  reason are surrounded by great masses of mammals who are uninvolved in the
  speech. Funny that. Rotate eye contact over your three best friends as you
  talk, at whatever a natural pace would be for you. (If you don't know what a
  natural pace is, two sentences or so works for me to a first approximation.)
  Everyone in the audience -- both your friends and the uninvolved mammals --
  will perceive that you are looking directly at them for enough of the speech
  to feel flattered but not quite enough to feel creepy.  4) Podiums were
  invented by some sadist who hates introverts. Don't give him the
  satisfaction. Speak from a vantage point where the crowd can see your entire
  body.  5) Hands: pockets, no, pens, no, fidgeting, no. Gestures, yes. If you
  don't have enough gross motor control to talk and gesture at the same time
  (no joke, this was once a problem for me) then having them in a neutral
  position in front of your body works well.  6) Many people have different
  thoughts on the level of preparation or memorization which is required. In
  general, having strong control of the narrative structure of your speech
  without being wedded to the exact ordering of sentences is a good balance for
  most people. (The fact that you're coming to the conclusion shouldn't
  surprise you.) 7) If you remember nothing else on microtactical phrasing when
  you're up there, remember that most people do not naturally include enough
  transition words when speaking informally, which tends to make speeches loose
  narrative cohesion. Throw in a few more than you would ordinarily think to
  do. ("Another example of this...", "This is why...", "Furthermore...", etc
  etc.)

Gromov that began by the remark that not only 4 equals 2 plus 2, but this equality is true in 3 different ways (meaning that there are three equipartitions in two classes of a 4-element set). According to him, a lot of exceptional behaviors in math stem from this, especially from the fact that 3 < 4 (it definitely explains why the alternating group A(4) isn't simple, but Gromov also mentioned the gauge-theoretic oddities in dimension 4).

> information theory, called "information cohomology" (see "The homological

> as introduced by Grothendieck, Verdier and their collaborators in the SGA IV.
> It also contains several new constructions and results. (1) We define
> generalized information structures, as categories of finite random variables
> related by a notion of extension or refinement; probability spaces are models
> (or representations) for these general structures. Generalized information
> structures form a category with finite products and coproducts. We prove that
> information cohomology is invariant under isomorphisms of generalized
> structures. (2) We prove that the relatively-free bar construction gives a
> projective object for the computation of cohomology. (3) We provide detailed
> computations of H1 and describe the "degenerate" cases. (4) We establish the
> homological nature of Tsallis entropy. (5) We re-interpret Shannon's axioms
> for a 'measure of choice' in the light of this theory and provide a

- SIMD parsers are sort of like parsers that build an index/semi-index. Can we
  use this to build a restartable semi-indexed parser? This will let us use
  seekable machines to play rank/select tricks, while being "fast" and
  "good in memory" (succinct). Krohn rhodes theory may tell us how to cascade
  the automata correctly.

  Describes "supergeometry", where we analyze `Z[x1,..., xn, e1, ... en]`
  where the `ei` anticommute amongst themselves, and commute with the `xi`.
  This gives it a symplectic dimension (`ei`), regular space dimension (`xi`),
  plus a single `Z` dimension. This somehow leads to the notion that `Spec(Z)` ought
  to be thought of as a 3-manifold..

> The drama triangle is a social model of human interaction – the triangle maps
> a type of destructive interaction that can occur between people in conflict
> The triangle of actors in the drama are oppressors, victims and rescuers.
  **The Victim:** The Victim's stance is "Poor me!" The Victim feels
  victimized, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems
  unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life, or achieve
  insight.  The Victim, if not being persecuted, will seek out a Persecutor and
  also a Rescuer who will save the day but also perpetuate the Victim's
  negative feelings.  **The Rescuer:** The rescuer's line is "Let me help you."
  A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if they don't go to the rescue.
  Yet their rescuing has negative effects: It keeps the Victim dependent and
  gives the Victim permission to fail. The rewards derived from this rescue
  role are that the focus is taken off of the rescuer. When they focus their
  energy on someone else, it enables them to ignore their own anxiety and
  issues. This rescue role is also pivotal because their actual primary
  interest is really an avoidance of their own problems disguised as concern
  for the victim’s needs.  **The Persecutor: (a.k.a. Villain):** The Persecutor
  insists, "It's all your fault." The Persecutor is controlling, blaming,
  critical, oppressive, angry, authoritarian, rigid, and superior.

- [From Tao's article on gauges](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/what-is-a-gauge/):
    (i) Quivers. This theory basically concerns connections on vector bundles over
     (usually finite) directed graphs. One novel feature, over manifolds, is
     that the dimension of the “bundle” may change over different points. The
     “connection”, usually called a representation of the quiver, is a choice
     of linear map for each edge of the graph. If one fixes a gauge, i.e. a
     basis for each vector space, then the theory is boring — the space of
     connections is itself a big vector space. The interest is in the gauge
     transformations, whose group is the product of the general linear groups
     of the vector spaces. (ii) Currency trading

- [Tools for Convivality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality)
> Radical monopoly is a concept defined by philosopher and author Ivan Illich
> in his 1973 book, "Tools for Conviviality," and revisited in his later work,
> which describes how a technology or service becomes so exceptionally dominant
> that even with multiple providers, its users are excluded from society

> societies, where the car itself shaped cities by its needs, so much so that
> people without cars become excluded from participation in cities. A radical

> any one brand.  Social media as a technology in the forms of
> Facebook/Instagram/Twitter could be seen as a radical monopoly for

  recommend reading anything by Alan Reid. He has some course notes floating
  around which cover arbitrary hyperbolic n-manifolds, though I can't seem to
  track them down at the moment.  People often focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds
  because there are some very strong links to number theory (e.g. Spec(Z)
  behaves like a 3-manifold in certain ways), but the machinery works for
  higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds as well. "Arithmetic hyperbolic
  manifolds" is a good keyword to look for if you want to dig deeper.

  around it. consider tangent spaces. now perform DHMC on this space?
  Problem is that the "interesting" points are vertices, so we may
  not gain much. However, what happens if we tesselate the space
  with birkhoff polytopes? Perhaps likely we get something? it's
  unclear, but very interesting for sure.

  Think of a good _algebra_ for this duality between "slots" and "indexes"
- ponder an algebra that gives us _segments_: ie, given a list, gives us [left..right],
  given a tree, gives us subtree representation (eg. recover euler tour?)
- build language to convert between 'flat' memory representations and
  data manipulation. eg. `list a = cons a (list a) | nil`. this in sparse form
  is linked list, in dense form is array. `tree a = nil | branch a (tree a) (tree a)` in
  sparse form is tree, in dense form is some dense repr. `complete a = leaf a | branch (complete a) (complete a)`
  is tree in sparse form, heap in dense form.
