> My friend had gone through an elaborate process that basically amounted to
> performing some other piece of music four minutes and thirty-three seconds
> long, with a software synthesizer and the volume set to zero.  The result was
> an appropriate-sized file of zeroes - which he compressed with an MP3
> compressor.  The MP3 file was bit-for-bit identical to one that would have been
> produced by compressing /dev/zero...  but this file was (he claimed)
> legitimately a recording of 4'33" and the other one wouldn't have been.  The
> difference was the Colour of the bits.  He was asserting that the bits in his
> copy of 433.mp3 had a different Colour from those in a copy of 433.mp3 I might
> make by means of the /dev/zero procedure, even though the two files would
> contain exactly the same bits.
> ...
> The trouble is, human beings are not in general Colour-blind.  The law is not
> Colour-blind.  It makes a difference not only what bits you have, but where
> they came from.  There's a very interesting Web page illustrating the Coloured
> nature of bits in law on the US Naval Observatory Web site.  They provide

> they also provide it under a disclaimer saying that this information is not
> suitable for use in court.  If you need to know when the Sun rose or set for

> actually just need the bits that say when the Sun rose.  You need those bits to
> be Coloured with the Colour that allows them to be admissible in court, and the

> This paper presents a self-replicating, homeostatic phenomenon called M0. M0
> runs parasitically on populations of humans. It is remarkable in that
> although its anatomy is distributed across all phenomenological layers from
> neurological to paradigmattic, its causal sequences are robust and (once
> exposed) readily traceable and hence vulnerable to counterattack.
> The anatomy and lifecycle of the parasite are described, together with
> several secondary effects which are often of primary importance to the host
> population. An alternative interpretation of the role of dopamine in
> controlling mood and awareness is proposed, and how the "security breach"
> thus exposed is exploited by M0 is shown. A disturbing model of the
> variability of human consciousness is proposed.

> This hypothesis proposes that ADHD represents a lack of adaptation of members

> Hartmann developed the idea first as a mental model after his own son was
> diagnosed with ADHD, stating, "It's not hard science, and was never intended to
> be.". However, more recent molecular and clinical research has given support
> to a genetic deflection ”theory” of ADHD arising from evolutionary adaptation
> Hartmann notes that most or all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers for
> hundreds of thousands of years, but that this standard gradually changed as
> agriculture developed in most societies, and more people worldwide became
> farmers. Over many years, most humans adapted to farming cultures, but Hartmann
> speculates that people with ADHD retained some of the older hunter
> characteristics.  A key component of the hypothesis is that the proposed "hyperfocus" aspect of
> ADHD is a gift or benefit under appropriate circumstances. The hypothesis also
> explains the distractibility factor in ADHD individuals and their short
> attention span for subject matter that does not interest the individual (which
> may or may not trigger hyperfocus), along with various other characteristics
> such as difficulty adhering to social norms, poor planning and organizing
> ability, distorted sense of time, impatience, attraction to variety or novelty
> or excitement, and impulsiveness.[citation needed] It is argued that in the

> How big are gender differences in personality and interests, and how stable are
> these differences across cultures and over time? To answer these questions, I
> summarize data from two meta‐analyses and three cross‐cultural studies on

  Describes "supergeometry", where we analyze `Z[x1,..., xn, e1, ... en]`
  where the `ei` anticommute amongst themselves, and commute with the `xi`.
  This gives it a symplectic dimension (`ei`), regular space dimension (`xi`),
  plus a single `Z` dimension. This somehow leads to the notion that `Spec(Z)` ought
  to be thought of as a 3-manifold..

> The drama triangle is a social model of human interaction – the triangle maps
> a type of destructive interaction that can occur between people in conflict
> The triangle of actors in the drama are oppressors, victims and rescuers.
  **The Victim:** The Victim's stance is "Poor me!" The Victim feels
  victimized, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems
  unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life, or achieve
  insight.  The Victim, if not being persecuted, will seek out a Persecutor and
  also a Rescuer who will save the day but also perpetuate the Victim's
  negative feelings.  **The Rescuer:** The rescuer's line is "Let me help you."
  A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if they don't go to the rescue.
  Yet their rescuing has negative effects: It keeps the Victim dependent and
  gives the Victim permission to fail. The rewards derived from this rescue
  role are that the focus is taken off of the rescuer. When they focus their
  energy on someone else, it enables them to ignore their own anxiety and
  issues. This rescue role is also pivotal because their actual primary
  interest is really an avoidance of their own problems disguised as concern
  for the victim’s needs.  **The Persecutor: (a.k.a. Villain):** The Persecutor
  insists, "It's all your fault." The Persecutor is controlling, blaming,
  critical, oppressive, angry, authoritarian, rigid, and superior.

- [From Tao's article on gauges](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/what-is-a-gauge/): 
    (i) Quivers. This theory basically concerns connections on vector bundles over
     (usually finite) directed graphs. One novel feature, over manifolds, is
     that the dimension of the “bundle” may change over different points. The
     “connection”, usually called a representation of the quiver, is a choice
     of linear map for each edge of the graph. If one fixes a gauge, i.e. a
     basis for each vector space, then the theory is boring — the space of
     connections is itself a big vector space. The interest is in the gauge
     transformations, whose group is the product of the general linear groups
     of the vector spaces. (ii) Currency trading

- [Tools for Convivality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality)
> Radical monopoly is a concept defined by philosopher and author Ivan Illich
> in his 1973 book, "Tools for Conviviality," and revisited in his later work,
> which describes how a technology or service becomes so exceptionally dominant
> that even with multiple providers, its users are excluded from society
> without access to the product. His initial example is the effect of cars on
> societies, where the car itself shaped cities by its needs, so much so that
> people without cars become excluded from participation in cities. A radical
> monopoly is when the dominance of one type of product supersedes dominance by
> any one brand.  Social media as a technology in the forms of
> Facebook/Instagram/Twitter could be seen as a radical monopoly for
> reputation, as is Linkedin for employment, colleges for education, etc.  I
> think Illich's criticisms of car culture pushed him outside the Overton
> window of policy making, but his radical monopoly concept is a useful
> critical tool for reasoning about tech and ethics. A counter argument could
> use the example that the discovery of fire created a radical monopoly on
> heat, and therefore it's so general as to be applied arbitrarily to anything
> you don't like. However, being able to think about the consequences of a new
> radical monopoly might have on some aspect of human experience is useful for

  natural PDE's on hyperbolic manifolds are linked with cohomology of
  arithmetic groups." I picked it up from a variety of sources, but I'd
  recommend reading anything by Alan Reid. He has some course notes floating
  around which cover arbitrary hyperbolic n-manifolds, though I can't seem to
  track them down at the moment.  People often focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds
  because there are some very strong links to number theory (e.g. Spec(Z)
  behaves like a 3-manifold in certain ways), but the machinery works for
  higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds as well. "Arithmetic hyperbolic
  manifolds" is a good keyword to look for if you want to dig deeper.
