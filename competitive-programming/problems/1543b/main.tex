\section{1543B: Customising the Track}
Given a list of numbers $a[1\dots N]$, we must minimize the total absolute value
error $\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n |a[j] - a[i]|$. Suppose we have two elements $a[l], a[r]$
which have a height difference of more than 2: $|a[l] - a[r]| \geq 2$. WLOG, suppose $a[r] > a[l]$,
and thus $a[r] - a[l] \geq 2$.
