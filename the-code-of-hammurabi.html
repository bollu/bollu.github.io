 <span class='centered'>I've wanted to read the code of hammurabi since it was name dropped in 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash><span class='centered'>Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I finally got around to it. Here's some excerpts I found fascinating. The 
 <span class='centered'>numbers are according to  
 <span class='centered'><a href=http://www.general-intelligence.com/library/hr.pdf><span class='centered'>this translation of the Code of Hammurabi </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>Some helpful hints were found from the 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/><span class='centered'>Avalon ancient law codes page of the Yale law school </a>.  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (5) If a judge try a case, reach a decision, and present his judgment in <span class='centered'>writing; if later error shall appear in his decision,and it be through his <span class='centered'>own fault, then he shall pay twelve times the fine set by him in the case, and <span class='centered'>he shall be publicly removed from the judge’s bench, and never again shall he <span class='centered'>sit there to render judgement. ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: These are steep penalties for <span class='centered'>getting a case wrong. I suppose this encouraged innocent until proven guilty <span class='centered'>quite a bit.) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (23) If the robber is not caught, then shall he who was robbed claim under <span class='centered'>oath the amount of his loss; then shall the community, and...on whose <span class='centered'>ground and territory and in whose domain it was compensate him for the goods <span class='centered'>stolen ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: This rule appears to setup some sort of insurance where <span class='centered'>someone who is robbed is guaranteed recompence) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (108) If a tavern-keeper (feminine) does not accept corn according to gross <span class='centered'>weight in payment of drink, but takes money, and the price of the drink is <span class='centered'>less than that of the corn, she shall be convicted and thrown into the water. <span class='centered'>( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: I wonder why this rule specifically singles out women) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (120) If any one store corn for safe keeping in another person’s house, and <span class='centered'>any harm happen to the corn in storage, or if the owner of the house open the <span class='centered'>granary and take some of the corn, or if especially he deny that the corn was <span class='centered'>stored in his house: then the owner of the corn shall claim his corn before God <span class='centered'>(on oath), and the owner of the house shall pay its owner for all of the corn <span class='centered'>that he took. ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: I wonder whether there were many 'owners of corn' <span class='centered'>who swore false oaths. I suppose not, if this rule was enshrined into law. <span class='centered'>It is interesting that they held oaths to god as a mechanism to prevent lying) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (137) 137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, <span class='centered'>or from his wife who has borne him children: then he shall give that wife her <span class='centered'>dowry, and a part of the usufruct offield, garden, and property, so that she <span class='centered'>can rear her children.When she has brought up her children, a portion of all <span class='centered'>that is given to the children, equal as that of one son, shall be given to her. <span class='centered'>She may then marry the man of her heart. ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: their society <span class='centered'>seems egalitarian, and provides both a mechanism of divorce, and rights <span class='centered'>and property to the wife after divorce). </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (168) If a man wish to put his son out of his house, and declare before the <span class='centered'>judge: “I want to put my son out,” then the judge shall examine into his <span class='centered'>reasons. If the son be guilty of no great fault, for which he can be <span class='centered'>rightfully put out, the father shall not put him out; (169). If he be guilty of a <span class='centered'>grave fault, which should rightfully deprive him of the filial relationship, <span class='centered'>the father shall forgive him the first time; but if he be guilty of a grave <span class='centered'>fault a second time the father may deprive his son of all filial relation. <span class='centered'>( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: I find this notion of 'forgive once' being encoded into law <span class='centered'>very interesting. I don't know of other law codes that have such a thing). </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (188). If an artizan has undertaken to rear a child and teaches him his <span class='centered'>craft, he can not be demanded back; (189) If he has not taught him his craft, <span class='centered'>this adopted son may return to his father’s house. ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: I find it <span class='centered'>interesting that this notion of 'taking a son' is intertwined with caring <span class='centered'>for the son and teaching them a craft to become a future productive member <span class='centered'>of society) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (196) If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out. <span class='centered'>[ An eye for an eye  ].  ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: Fascinating that 'eye for an eye' comes from the code). </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (202). If any one strike the body of a man higher in rank than he,he shall <span class='centered'>receive sixty blows with an ox-whip in public.  <span class='centered'>( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: Neat how one can glean the existence of a social hierarchy <span class='centered'>from a law code. I wonder how this hierarchy was defined.) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (215) If a physician make a large incision with an operating knife and cure <span class='centered'>it, or if he open a tumor (over the eye) with an operating knife, and saves <span class='centered'>the eye, he shall receive ten shekels in money. <span class='centered'>( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: (i) It is weird that things like doctor's procedures are covered <span class='centered'>in the law code. How often is the code revised? What happens when a doctor <span class='centered'>comes up with a new treatment? (ii) It is weird that the prices are recorded <span class='centered'>in the law code. What about inflation?) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> (249) If any one hire an ox, and God strike it that it die, the man who hired <span class='centered'>it shall swear by God and be considered guiltless. ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: Once again, <span class='centered'>their belief in the truthfulness of oaths sworn to God. Also, it's nice to <span class='centered'>know that they do understand and account for truly random events that one <span class='centered'>has no control over) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Epilogue: In future time, through all coming generations, let the king,who may be in the <span class='centered'>land, observe the words of righteousness which I have written on my monument; <span class='centered'>let him not alter the law of the land which I have given, the edicts which I <span class='centered'>have enacted; my monument let him not mar. If such a ruler have wisdom, and <span class='centered'>beable to keep his land in order, he shall observe the words which I have <span class='centered'>written in this inscription ( <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>Commentary </i></i>: This advice for future kings is <span class='centered'>interesting, and appears to imply that the rules and all the prices in the <span class='centered'>rules ought to be immutable. I really do wonder how they dealt with their  <span class='centered'>society changing, new inventions, and inflation) </li></ul> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hammint.asp><span class='centered'>Taken from this introduction to the code of hammurabi from Yale </a>: <span class='centered'>An accused person was allowed to cast himself into "the river," the Euphrates. <span class='centered'>Apparently the art of swimming was unknown; for if the current bore him to the <span class='centered'>shore alive he was declared innocent, if he drowned he was guilty. So we learn <span class='centered'>that faith in the justice of the ruling gods was already firmly, though <span class='centered'>somewhat childishly, established in the minds of men </li></ul>
