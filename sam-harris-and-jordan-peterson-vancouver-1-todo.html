<blockquote><span class='centered'> Is there a difference between religious and non-religious totalitarian states?<span class='centered'> Yes, dogma is the commonality. In the case of stalin / north korea, they<span class='centered'> are almost religions that are not branded as "religions". ~ Sam</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> the problem with dogmas is that they do not allow revision. The moment someone<span class='centered'> has a better idea you have to shut it down. ~ Sam</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Free speech elevates error correction of dogmas above dogmas. So <span class='centered'> Free speech must be on the pinnacle in the hierarchy of values ~ Peterson</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> The only problem with the religion is the dogmatism. I've got no problem<span class='centered'> with the buildings and the music and ... ~ Sam Harris.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> What is the phenomenology of spiritual experience? That phenomenology is<span class='centered'> real! This phenomenology seems to confirm the dogma.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> The core element of tribal alliance is independent of the religious <span class='centered'> substrate? Religion can allow clearly good people who are not captured<span class='centered'> by tribalism are able to perform atrocities. This suffering is not from a<span class='centered'> "ape like" urge. If you buy the claim that quran is the perfect word, then<span class='centered'> human rationality is bounded pathologically  which leads to worrying<span class='centered'> outcomes.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Christians were the ones in egland who were against slavery ~ Petersen<span class='centered'> Yes, because they were the only ones around, so they must have done everything<span class='centered'> then ~ Sam<span class='centered'> Don't forget that the christians <i><span class='centered'>used their christian faith</i> as an argument<span class='centered'> against slavery ~Petersen<span class='centered'> Well then it's unfortunate that they were on the losing side of an argument. <span class='centered'> If only the bible had said "don't keep slaves" imagine how much easier their<span class='centered'> movement would have been ~Sam.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Rise of postmodern interpretations of literature. Take a complex narrative,<span class='centered'> there are many ways of interpreting it. For example, consider a movie with<span class='centered'> a twist at the end. The twist changes the emaning of the entire movie. So while<span class='centered'> the bible may contain, sentence by sentence, things that are "just wrong"<span class='centered'> from a modern lens, perhaps it's not so when viewed holistically. <span class='centered'> Everything in a narraitve is conditioned on the entire text. While you<span class='centered'> may argue that some sentences in the bible are so horrific that it's impossible<span class='centered'> to use context to massage them, you have to give the devil his due. The<span class='centered'> Christian bible is a narrative. </blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> OK, what does this do to Moses' laws of war and doctrines?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> the notion of revelation and prophecy destroys a whole bunch of <span class='centered'> soceity. I've read to the end of the book, it's scary to the end as well!</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> there is an idea in the bible, that things are always going to be falling<span class='centered'> apart, there is an apocalyptic crux to everything touched by humanity.<span class='centered'> Hero is born in the darkest point in the journey. When things fall apart,<span class='centered'> that is the time of the hero.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> You can read into any story psychological insights ~ Sam. But you can do that<span class='centered'> with any set of facts too ~ Peterson. This why fundamentalim has an edge<span class='centered'> over modern theology. Modern theology concedes that we can't read it literally.<span class='centered'> But the more you get away from the literal you can broadcast whatever you want.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> This notion that redemption is to be found in truthful speech is embodied<span class='centered'> as a person. you want to ground values in something that is true. But the<span class='centered'> problem is that i can't see how you can inerpret the world of facts without<span class='centered'> an a priori structure.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Kant identified time and space as a priori intuitions. I claim that stories<span class='centered'> are another kind of a priori intuition. You can write down stories of utpoia<span class='centered'> and dystopia; When you do, you're already two thirds your way to heaven and<span class='centered'> hell. Why not go all the way?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Literal versus metaphorical truth. There are some truths that are literally<span class='centered'> false but if you behave as if they were true you come out ahead. </blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Imagine a universe where every possible mind is tuned to the worst possible<span class='centered'> experience that they can. If anything is bad, that's bad. If the word bad<span class='centered'> is going to mean anything, it's bad. I claim that this is a "factual claim".<span class='centered'> Every claim we make about anything, turtles all the way down, gets us to<span class='centered'> something that's bedrocked on intuition [Perhaps even math, in terms of<span class='centered'> the axioms <i><span class='centered'>we choose</i>? Mh, I'm not very convinced, but sure]. If we are<span class='centered'> going to use the word bad and good, there will be an implicit acknowledgement<span class='centered'> that the worse possible misery for everyone is <i><span class='centered'>bad</i>. It's <i><span class='centered'>built in</i>. ~ Sam<span class='centered'> Jordan disagrees that this is a factual claim.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Why did people do the worst things </blockquote>
