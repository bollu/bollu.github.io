> How do you approach problems you don’t understand right away?

Since I build new algorithms, this is a daily occurrence.
- I try to find the largrest trivial subproblem contained in the given problem,
  and then add one piece of complexity to it.
- I try to generalize the problem till it's at the right level of abstraction, which often
  makes it easier to solver.
- If the problem is amenable to computation, I often write a brute force enumerator
  to understand the structure of the solution space.
- I find counter-examples to *much stronger* versions of the problem, in order to better
  understand what the limits are.
- I take a walk, and meditate on the problem during the walk.
- And, last but not least, I use a rubber duck to chat about the problem with :)



> What’s something you’ve built, written, or debugged that you’re proud of? Why?


I've written a large portion of the Lean proof assistant's proof automatition for working with
bitvectors, which are a fundamental building block for program verification.
This involved writing many proofs of correctness in Lean, and I'm proud that the result
is robust, fast, and easy to use (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3763167)
