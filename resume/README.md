I'm an expert in formal verification, the implementation of functional programming languages, and applied category theory. Lean, decision procedures:

I am in the top 20 contributors to the Lean theorem prover overall, with him in the top two contributors of the Lean bitvector theory.

I'm an author of the Lean4 metaprogramming book and has written a large part of the necessary theorems for proving Lean's bitblaster (bv_decide) correct.

Compilers & HPC: I have deep experience on high performance computing and loop optimization: Polly is a research loop optimizer for the LLVM project, a production-grade compiler optimization framework. Polly was the first to create a framework for loop analysis and optimisation that brought mathematical research ideas in polyhedral compilation to real-world ideas. Technical successors of Polly that use many of its innovations are used to accelerate large machine learning models today. I have contributed 121 patches to Polly, making him among the top three contributors to the Polly loop optimizer. Thanks to my work, the Polly loop optimizer gained the ability to perform high-performance GPU code generation for realistic climate models, including the dynamical core of COSMO, Switzerland's official climate model maintained by the MeteoSwiss, Switzerland's Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. I then continued to oversee the Polly project and has even mentored students working on the Polly project as a Google Summer of Code mentor in 2016.

Functional Programming: I have been into functional programming since I was a teenager, and I was hired by Tweag, a research organization to implement a new Haskell to WebAssembly compiler (Asterius), and is in the top two contributors to Asterius, which was eventually merged into the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

AI for Maths: My long term vision is to build scalable systems for mathematical theorem proving, as the bitter lesson teaches us that only search scales. Toward this, during an internship at Microsoft Research in 2023, he worked on reinforcement-learning based approaches for correcting incorrect proofs in the F* proof assistant, which was published as "Towards neural synthesis for SMT-assisted proof-oriented programming"@ICSE 2025. Similarly, he has helped established stronger baselines for AI based geometric theorem proving, by showing that symbolic methods, when used well, go head-to-head with state of the art AI based systems.
