 <span class='centered'>How does the fact that we will die affect the way we live? previous 
 <span class='centered'>chapter! The fact our mortality raises the question of whether or not 
 <span class='centered'>we should put an end to our life. It's the extra feature --- the variability 
 <span class='centered'>of death, the fact that we can control how long we live, and thus we face 
 <span class='centered'>the possibility of ending our life earlier than it would otherwise. Under what 
 <span class='centered'>circumstances is it a good thing to do?  
 <span class='centered'>You must be either crazy or immoral is the knee jerk. The very first thing 
 <span class='centered'>to do is to distinguish questions of rationality from morality.  
 <h4><a id=articles/rationality-of-suicide href='#articles/rationality-of-suicide'> § </a><span class='centered'> Rationality of suicide </h4> 
 <ol><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> When if ever would it be true that you are better off dead? </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Assume that the answer to the first question is "under circumstance X, </li></ol> <span class='centered'> you would be better off dead", can you trust your judgement that this is one 
 <span class='centered'>   of those cases X?  
 <span class='centered'>In those circumstances that life is terrible, you can't think clearly. So perhaps 
 <span class='centered'>you ought not attempt to make "rational decisions" under duress. Non existence 
 <span class='centered'>is not a state because it depends on existence.  
 <span class='centered'>Dying would be bad because it would deprive us of the good things in life --- 
 <span class='centered'>the deprivation requirement.  If we believe in the two state requirement, how 
 <span class='centered'>can we say this?  The two state argument can't even tell us that it's 
 <span class='centered'>better off to be alive for the happiest person! So the two state requirement 
 <span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>is not a genuine requirement </i></i>. We simply have to say that the life you would 
 <span class='centered'>have had is a great life; I don't need to say anything about how death is going 
 <span class='centered'>to be inferior. The "loss of a good state" is enough, without needing to know 
 <span class='centered'>what we are transitioning  <i><span class='centered'>into </i>.  
 <span class='centered'>But if so, we can flip the argument by symmetry. If a person's life was full 
 <span class='centered'>of suffering and misery and disappointment, then for their life to go 
 <span class='centered'>longer would be bad.  
 <span class='centered'>What goes into making someone's life worthwhile? people disagree about the 
 <span class='centered'>ingredients of the best kind of life. Going back to hedonism (add all pleasure, 
 <span class='centered'>subtract all pain), if this number comes out negative, then your life is not 
 <span class='centered'>worth living. The longer you live, the more the balance shifts to the negative 
 <span class='centered'>(say).  
 <span class='centered'>Is life itself worth having? Neural container theory: life is a container 
 <span class='centered'>in which good/bad is filled up. Valuable container theories: the very fact 
 <span class='centered'>that you are alive gave you some positive value. Fantastic continer theories: 
 <span class='centered'>doesn't matter how bad the contents get, even so the grand total is still 
 <span class='centered'>positive. What's so incredible about life itself? They argue that being 
 <span class='centered'>alive itself is valuable. But most people don't really mean life, they mean 
 <span class='centered'>life as a person. For example, they would not agree that being alive as a 
 <span class='centered'>blade of grass is a "good life".  
 <span class='centered'>What about a life where the person's functioning has decayed, but they can still 
 <span class='centered'>feel pain? In that case perhaps, their life's quality can degrade.  
 <span class='centered'>We can probably find sympathy with the perspective that here on out, their 
 <span class='centered'>life is going to be net negative; someone who has terminal cancer and is in 
 <span class='centered'>great pain.  
 <span class='centered'>There could be a person where they're suffering from a degenerative diesease, 
 <span class='centered'>but are still able to think and have a life worth living while slowly losing 
 <span class='centered'>motor control. One day there comes a time when their life is not worth living, 
 <span class='centered'>but by that point, they don't have control over their body.  
 <span class='centered'>It's easy to mistake a low point with a global minima; Even if life is 
 <span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>less worth living </i> than you hope it would be, it might feel terrible in 
 <span class='centered'>the position.

 <span class='centered'>The very claim that "jones would be better off dead" can't make any sense. In 
 <span class='centered'>order to make comparisons we need to be able to talk about states before 
 <span class='centered'>and after. Call this the two state requirement.
