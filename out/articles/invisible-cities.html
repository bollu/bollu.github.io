 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The city does not consist of this, but of relationships between the <span class='centered'> measurements of its space and the events of its past: the height of a lamppost <span class='centered'> and the distance from the ground of a hanged usurper’s swaying feet </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must <span class='centered'> admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to <span class='centered'> describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is <span class='centered'> reflected exactly in the city of monsters. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> ... seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, <span class='centered'> are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Bear with me,’ that man answered. ‘I am a wandering herdsman. Sometimes my <span class='centered'> goats and I have to pass through cities; but we are unable to distinguish them. <span class='centered'> Ask me the names of the grazing lands: I know them all, the Meadow between the <span class='centered'> Cliffs, the Green Slope, the Shadowed Grass. Cities have no name for me: they <span class='centered'> are places without leaves, separating one pasture from another, and where the <span class='centered'> goats are frightened at street corners and scatter. The dog and I run to keep <span class='centered'> the flock together.’ </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> description of Zaira as it is today should contain all Zaira’s past. The city, <span class='centered'> however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, <span class='centered'> written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the <span class='centered'> banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the <span class='centered'> flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The city’s gods, according to some people, live in the depths, in the black <span class='centered'> lake that feeds the underground streams. According to others, the gods live in <span class='centered'> the buckets that rise, suspended from a cable, as they appear over the edge of <span class='centered'> the wells, in the revolving pulleys, in the windlasses of the norias, in the <span class='centered'> pump handles, in the blades of the windmills that draw the water up from the <span class='centered'> drillings, in the trestles that support the twisting probes, in the reservoirs <span class='centered'> perched on stilts over the roofs, in the slender arches of the aqueducts, in <span class='centered'> all the columns of water, the vertical pipes, the plungers, the drains, </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> the emperor is he who is a foreigner to each of his subjects, and only through <span class='centered'> foreign eyes and ears could the empire manifest its existence to Kublai. In <span class='centered'> languages incomprehensible to the Khan, the envoys related information heard in <span class='centered'> languages incomprehensible to them: from this opaque, dense stridor emerged the <span class='centered'> revenues received by the imperial treasury, the first and last names of <span class='centered'> officials dismissed and decapitated, the dimensions of the canals that the <span class='centered'> narrow rivers fed in times of drought. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Marco Polo imagined answering (or Kubiai Khan imagined his answer) that the <span class='centered'> more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one <span class='centered'> understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there; and he retraced the <span class='centered'> stages of his journeys, and he came to know the port from which he had set <span class='centered'> sail, and the familiar places of his youth, and the surroundings of home, and a <span class='centered'> little, square of Venice where he gambolled as a child. At this point Kublai <span class='centered'> Khan interrupted him or imagined interrupting him, or Marco Polo imagined <span class='centered'> himself interrupted, with a question such as: ‘You advance always with your <span class='centered'> head turned back?’ or ‘Is what you see always behind you?’ or rather, ‘Does <span class='centered'> your journey take place only in the past?’ </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> It is pointless to ask whether the new ones are better or worse than the old, <span class='centered'> since there is no connection between them, just as the old postcards do not <span class='centered'> depict Maurilia as it was, but a different city which, by chance, was called <span class='centered'> Maurilia, like this one. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> No one remembers what need or command or desire drove Zenobia’s founders to <span class='centered'> give their city this form, and so there is no telling whether it was satisfied <span class='centered'> by the city as we see it today, which has perhaps grown through successive <span class='centered'> superimpositions from the first, now undecipherable plan. But what is certain <span class='centered'> is that if you ask an inhabitant of Zenobia to describe his vision of a happy <span class='centered'> life, it is always a city like Zenobia that he imagines, with its pilings and <span class='centered'> its suspended stairways, a Zenobia perhaps quite different, a-flutter with <span class='centered'> banners and ribbons, but always derived by combining elements of that first <span class='centered'> model. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> the others tell, each one, his tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, <span class='centered'> lovers, battles. And you know that in the long journey ahead of you, when to <span class='centered'> keep awake against the camel’s swaying or the junk’s rocking, you start <span class='centered'> summoning up your memories one by one, your wolf will have become another wolf, <span class='centered'> your sister a different sister, your battle other battles, on your return from <span class='centered'> Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at every solstice and at every <span class='centered'> equinox. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Kublai interrupted him: ‘From now I shall describe the cities and you will tell <span class='centered'> me if they exist and are as I have conceived them </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Abandoned before or after it was inhabited. Armilla cannot be called deserted </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> A girl comes along, twirling a parasol on her shoulder, and twirling slightly <span class='centered'> also her rounded hips. A woman in black comes along, showing her full age, her <span class='centered'> eyes restless beneath her veil, her lips trembling. A tattooed giant comes <span class='centered'> along; a young man with white hair; a female dwarf; two girls, twins, dressed <span class='centered'> in coral. Something runs among them, an exchange of glances like lines that <span class='centered'> connect one figure with another and draw arrows, stars, triangles, until all <span class='centered'> combinations are used up in a moment, and other characters come on to the scene </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The ancients built Valdrada on the shores of a lake, with houses all verandas <span class='centered'> one above the other, and high streets whose railed parapets look out over the <span class='centered'> water. Thus the traveller, arriving, sees two cities: one erect above the lake, <span class='centered'> and the other reflected, upside-down </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Even when lovers twist their naked bodies, skin against skin, seeking the <span class='centered'> position that will give one the most pleasure in the other, even when murderers <span class='centered'> plunge the knife into the black veins of the neck and more clotted blood pours <span class='centered'> out the more they press the blade that slips between the tendons, it is not so <span class='centered'> much their copulating or murdering that matters as the copulating or murdering <span class='centered'> of the images, limpid and cold in the mirror. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The city of Sophronia is made up of two half cities. In one there is the great <span class='centered'> roller-coaster with its steep humps, the carousel with its chain spokes,...The <span class='centered'> other half-city is of stone and marble and cement, with the bank, the <span class='centered'> factories, the palaces, the slaughterhouse, the school, and all the rest. One <span class='centered'> of the half-cities is permanent, the other is temporary, and when the period if <span class='centered'> its sojourn is over, they uproot it, dismantle it....And so every year the day <span class='centered'> comes when the workmen remove the marble pediments, lower the stone walls, the <span class='centered'> cement pylons, take down the Ministry, the monument, the docks, the petroleum <span class='centered'> refinery, the hospital, load them on trailers, to follow from stand to stand <span class='centered'> their annual itinerary. .. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> then the whole citizenry decides to move to the next city, which is there <span class='centered'> waiting for them, empty and good as new; there each will take up a new job, a <span class='centered'> different wife, will see another landscape on opening his window, and will <span class='centered'> spend his time with different pastimes, friends, gossip. So their life is <span class='centered'> renewed from move to move, among cities whose exposure or declivity or streams <span class='centered'> or winds make each site somehow different from the others. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be <span class='centered'> deduced,’ Kublai said. ‘It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since <span class='centered'> the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only <span class='centered'> foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable <span class='centered'> combinations.’ ‘I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the <span class='centered'> others’ Marco answered, ‘It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, <span class='centered'> incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by <span class='centered'> reducing the number of elements, we increase the probability that the city <span class='centered'> really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in <span class='centered'> whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always <span class='centered'> as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: <span class='centered'> I would achieve cities too probable to be real.’ </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> This is the foundation of the city: a net which serves as passage and as <span class='centered'> support. All the rest, instead of rising up, is hung below... </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead <span class='centered'> outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more <span class='centered'> expressionsSuspended over the abyss, the life of Octavia’s inhabitants is <span class='centered'> less uncertain than in other cities. They know the net will last only so <span class='centered'> long. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Besides, the more Leonia’s talent for making new materials excels, the more <span class='centered'> the rubbish improves in quality, resists time, the elements, fermentations, <span class='centered'> combustions. A fortress of indestructible leftovers surrounds Leonia, <span class='centered'> dominating it on every side, like a chain of mountains. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'Why is Thekla’s construction taking such a long time?’ the inhabitants <span class='centered'> continue hoisting sacks, lowering leaded strings, moving long brushes up and <span class='centered'> down, as they answer, ‘So that its destruction cannot begin.’ And if asked <span class='centered'> whether they fear that, once the scaffolding is removed, the city may begin to <span class='centered'> crumble and fall to pieces, they add hastily, in a whisper, ‘Not only the <span class='centered'> city.’ </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'>  It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.’ </blockquote>
