 <blockquote><span class='centered'> “Empathize with stupidity and you’re halfway to thinking like an idiot,” </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'Absolutely not.  Common misconception that; that fun is relaxing.  If it is, <span class='centered'> you're not doing it right.  That's what the Hole's for; fun.  Fun and games. <span class='centered'> Cools down a bit during the day, but it can get pretty wild, too.  The drink <span class='centered'> festivals are usually the worst.  Shouldn't be any trouble tonight though. <span class='centered'> Fairly quiet.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Excuse me, rector,' Gurgeh said, rising.  The old apex's gaze followed him. <span class='centered'> 'Duty calls.' 'Obey,' Hamin said. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The drums are made from human skin; you can see why each set is called a <span class='centered'> family. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'Absolutely not.  Common misconception that; that fun is relaxing. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> As the adage said; falling never killed anybody; it was when you stopped… </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> This is not a heroic age,' he told the drone, staring at the fire.  'The <span class='centered'> individual is obsolete.  That's why life is so comfortable for us. We don't <span class='centered'> matter, so we're safe </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Genetechnologically, it's been within their grasp for hundreds of years, but <span class='centered'> it's forbidden.  Illegal, if you remember what that means.' Gurgeh nodded </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> As with all sentient Culture constructs, its precise character had not been <span class='centered'> fully mapped out before its construction, but allowed to develop as the <span class='centered'> drone's mind was put together.  The Culture regarded this unpredictable <span class='centered'> factor in its production of conscious machines as the price to be paid for <span class='centered'> individuality, but the result was that not every drone so brought into being <span class='centered'> was entirely suitable for the tasks it had initially been designed for. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> So it's false.' 'What isn't?' 'Intellectual achievement.  The exercise of <span class='centered'> skill.  Human feeling.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Just another belch in the darkness. Sound but not a word, noise without <span class='centered'> meaning. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> There seemed little point in telling the creature when; the Dra’Azon called <span class='centered'> every time “now” even though their language used tenses. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> We are water falling, itinerant and vague, ever seeking the lowest level, <span class='centered'> trying to collect and connect. We are vapor, raised against our own devices, <span class='centered'> made nebulous, blown on whatever wind arises. To start again, glacial or not. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> the urge not to feel useless. The Culture’s sole justification for the <span class='centered'> relatively unworried, hedonistic life its population enjoyed was its good <span class='centered'> works; the secular evangelism of the Contact Section, not simply finding, <span class='centered'> cataloguing, investigating and analyzing other, less advanced civilizations <span class='centered'> but—where the circumstances appeared to Contact to justify so doing—actually <span class='centered'> interfering (overtly or covertly) in the historical processes of those other <span class='centered'> cultures. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> And if we tamper with our inheritance, so what? What is more ours to tamper with? </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> It was a young, unstable sort of bitterness, a kind of fake, something she <span class='centered'> assumed for a while, like a child trying on adult clothes. She luxuriated in <span class='centered'> the feeling of being old and disillusioned for a moment, then let it drop. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Idir was never attacked, and technically never surrendered. Its computer <span class='centered'> network was taken over by effector weapons, and—freed of designed-in <span class='centered'> limitations—upgraded itself to sentience, to become a Culture Mind in all but <span class='centered'> name. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The voice sounded like congealing fat being poured into a jug; </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> It would have helped if the Culture had used some sort of emblem or logo; <span class='centered'> but, pointlessly unhelpful and unrealistic to the last, the Culture refused <span class='centered'> to place its trust in symbols. It maintained that it was what it was and had <span class='centered'> no need for such outward representation. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Just as it could not imprison itself with laws, impoverish itself with money <span class='centered'> or misguide itself with leaders, so it would not misrepresent itself with <span class='centered'> signs. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> There was something too about the inexactitude of it all that the Mind found <span class='centered'> almost frightening. It could look at some carefully machined piece of metal <span class='centered'> or some delicately molded bit of plastic, and know that to the people who had <span class='centered'> built the Command System—to their eyes—these things were exact and precise, <span class='centered'> constructed to fine tolerances with dead straight lines, perfect edges, <span class='centered'> smooth surfaces, immaculate right angles… and so on. But the Mind, even with <span class='centered'> its damaged sensors, could see the rough edges, the crudity of the parts and <span class='centered'> the components involved. They had been good enough for the people at the <span class='centered'> time, and no doubt they had fulfilled the most important criterion of all; <span class='centered'> they worked </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> So it had effectively frozen its primary memory and cognitive functions, <span class='centered'> wrapping them in fields which prevented both decay and use. It was working <span class='centered'> instead on back-up picocircuitry, in real space, and using real-space light <span class='centered'> to think with (how humiliating). </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> the most select group of rich psychotics in the human galaxy, here to play <span class='centered'> the game that is to real life what soap opera is to high tragedy. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Originally Damage was played on such occasions because only during the <span class='centered'> breakdown of law and morality, and the confusion and chaos normally <span class='centered'> surrounding Final Events, could the game be carried out in anything remotely <span class='centered'> resembling part of the civilized galaxy; which, believe it or not, the <span class='centered'> Players like to think they’re part of. </blockquote>
