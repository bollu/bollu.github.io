<blockquote><span class='centered'> The most intelligent creature in the universe is a rock.<span class='centered'> None would know it because they have lousy I/O.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Now symmetry and consistency are convertible terms - thus Poetry<span class='centered'> and Truth are one ~ Noether's theorem?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.<span class='centered'>(Alan Turing, quoted in J.D. Barrow, “Theories of everything”)</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> (I really detest the use of the word "training" in relation to professional<span class='centered'> activities. Training is what you do to dogs. What you should be doing with<span class='centered'> people is educating them, not training them. There is a big, big difference.)<span class='centered'> ~ Ron Garret at JPL</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> “Simulated consciousness" was as oxymoronic as "simulated addition.”</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> A cylinder will roll like a sphere in one direction but not roll like a cube<span class='centered'> in the other. That doesn't make it a sphere and a cube at the same time. It<span class='centered'> makes it something different. (in analogy to wave-particle duality)</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else<span class='centered'> can see..</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class='centered'> The manner in which the mathematician works his way towards discovery by<span class='centered'> shifting his confidence from intuition to computation and back again from<span class='centered'> computation to intuition, while never releasing his hold on either of the<span class='centered'> two, represents in miniature the whole range of operations by which<span class='centered'> articulation disciplines and expands the reasoning powers of man. (Personal<span class='centered'> Knowledge, 131)</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Everyone knows that putting a untrained business major in charge of a<span class='centered'> squadron of soldiers would end badly. He might be able skate by until they<span class='centered'> got into combat, maybe, but after that they wouldn’t listen to him for long.<span class='centered'> But for some reason we think that putting an mba in charge of an engineering<span class='centered'> team is a good idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> "On and on you will go, making sense of the world, forming notions of order,<span class='centered'> and being surprised in ways large and small by their failure, forever." —<span class='centered'> Albert Burneko on Wile E. Coyote.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class='centered'> Keep things in their Gauss given order. -- Gilbert Strang</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> It is interesting to see where people insist proximity to a subject makes one<span class='centered'> informed, and where they insist it makes them biased. It is interesting that<span class='centered'> they think it’s their call to make. [in the context of 'as a male, you don't<span class='centered'> get a say about toxic masculinity' v/s other 'viewpoints'] ~ <a href=https://medium.com/@jencoates/i-am-a-transwoman-i-am-in-the-closet-i-am-not-coming-out-4c2dd1907e42><span class='centered'>medium article link</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class='centered'> I hate greek drama. You know, wher everything happens off-stage. <span class='centered'> ~Downton abbey, s02e01</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> you have to speculate to accumulate</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> It's so reassuring to see the future unfurl, as long as you remember<span class='centered'> that it bears no resemblance to the past.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Sybil, vulgarity is no substitute for wit. ~  Violet, Downton Abbey</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> "Why dwell on that now?" "Because I want to feel the pleasure of telling you I<span class='centered'> told you so".</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under<span class='centered'> bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal loaves of bread.”</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> 'The history of transistors is the history of solving Schrödinger's equation in various materials.' -- Leon Lederman</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class='centered'> children cried with hunger. Women plaited their braids without flowers. ~ History of india podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> "There is a spooky quality about the ability of mathematicians to get there<span class='centered'> ahead of physicists. It's as if when Neil Armstrong first landed on the moon<span class='centered'> he found in the lunar dust the footsteps of Jules Verne" - Steven Weinberg on<span class='centered'> old math being applied in physics</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> You can try; trying is the first step of failure ~ GM Ben finegold on mating sequences.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class='centered'> David Marquet's credos from "Turn The Ship Around!". Don't ask "Are we<span class='centered'> ready?"; instead, ask "How ready are we?".  Everything needs to be phrased so<span class='centered'> as to invite people to express the knowledge they have, rather than demanding<span class='centered'> what amounts to a declaration of<span class='centered'> tribal identity.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> You can't just go around recognizing what people don't understand. That's<span class='centered'> what got Socrates killed. You've gotta make them understand what they don't<span class='centered'> understand without making them want to kill you. That's what makes a great<span class='centered'> teacher / leader / etc.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> 'Every work of art is an uncommitted crime.' - Adorno.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> Policies are nice but at the end of the day we need folks to set an example<span class='centered'> (rather than being made an example of)</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> “The math students dropped out because they could not understand anything. Of<span class='centered'> course, I didn’t understand anything either, but non-math students have a<span class='centered'> different standard of what it means to understand something,” Huh said. “I<span class='centered'> did understand some of the simple examples he showed in classes, and that was<span class='centered'> good enough for me.”<span class='centered'> https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-path-less-taken-to-the-peak-of-the-math-world-20170627/</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> "you're such a dick!". <span class='centered'> "I'm moby goddamn dick, and you're swimming in my water".</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought<span class='centered'> the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the<span class='centered'> earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your<span class='centered'> view is wronger than both of them put together.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class='centered'> "Ethereum has said they're moving from Proof of Work to Stake; I'm not<span class='centered'> surprised, given the Ethereum developers seem to abhor Work in all of its<span class='centered'> forms, including making progress on Ethereum itself"</blockquote>
