\section{Introduction}
This is a re-type of the RAND corporation report by Ford and Fulkerson. I hope
to re-type the essential parts of their notes, and then augment this with
push-relabel and dinic's as well.

\begin{definition}[Network]
     A directed network or a directed linear graph $G \equiv (N, A)$ consists
     of $N$ elements (nodes) $x, y, \cdots$ together with a subset $A \subseteq N \times N$ (arcs)
     of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of elements taken from $N$.
\end{definition}

The elements of $N$ are call nodes, and the elements of $A$ are called arcs.
Our networks are directed, as each arc carries an orientation. We may sometimes
refer to undirected networks where the set $A$ carries \emph{unordered} pairs
of nodes, or mixed networks in which some arcs are directed while others are
left undirected.

We rule out arcs of the form $(x, x)$ that lead from a node to itself. Thus
all arcs are of the form $(x, y)$ where $x \neq y$. Also while the existence
of at most one arc $(x, y)$ has been postulated, the notion of a network
frequently allows multiple arcs joining $x$ to $y$. For most problems we consider
the added generality adds nothing, so we shall continue to think of at most
one arc leading from one node to the other.


\section{Chains}

\begin{definition}[Chain]
Let $x_1, x_2, \dots x_n$ ($n \geq 2)$ be a sequence of nodes \emph{distinct} of a network
such that $(x_i, x_{(i+1)})$ is an arc for each $i = 1, 2, \dots, n-1$. Then
the sequence of nodes \emph{and} arcs:
\begin{equation}
    \tag{Definition of Chain}
    x_1, (x_1, x_2), x_2, \dots, (x_{(n-1)}, x_n), x_n
    \label{defn:chain}
\end{equation}
is called a \emph{chain}; it leads from $x_1$ to $x_n$. Sometimes for emphasis
we call \eqref{defn:chain} a \emph{Directed chain}. If the definition is altered
to have $x_n = x_1$, then the displayed sequence is a \emph{Directed cycle}.
\end{definition}

\section{Paths}
\begin{definition}[Path]
    Let $x_1, x_2, \dots x_n$ be a sequence of \emph{distinct} nodes such that
    either $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ is an arc, or $(x_{i+1}, x_i)$ is an arc for each
    $i = 1, 2, \dots, n-1$. Singling out, for each $i$, one of the two
    possibilities, we call the resulting sequence of nodes and arcs a \emph{path}
    from $x_1$ to $x_n$.
\end{definition}

Thus a path differs from a chain by allowing the possibility of traversing an
arc in a direction opposite to its orientation in going from $x_1$ to $x_n$. 
Note that for undirected networks, the two notions coincide.

Arcs $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ that belong to the path are called forward arcs; the
others are reverse arcs. In the definition of a path, if we stipulate $x_n = x_1$,
then the resulting sequence of nodes and arcs is a \emph{cycle}.

We may shorten the notation and refer unambiguously to the to the chain 
$x_1, \dots, x_n$ (as opposed to being explicit,
which is $x_1, (x_1, x_2), dots, (x_{n-1}, x_n), x_n$; to be tacit, we drop the arcs ).
Occasionally, we shall also refer to some path $x_1, \dots, x_n$;
Then it is to be understood that some selection of arcs has tacitly been made.

\section{Node-Arc incidence matrix}

\end{definition}

\section{Set based notation for functions}
% pg 20
To simplify the notation, we adopt the following conventions. If $X$ and $Y$
are subsets of $N$ let $(X, Y)$ denote the set of all arcs that lead from
$x \in X$ to $y \in Y$. For any function $g: A \rightarrow \R$, let:

\begin{equation}
    \tag{function on arc-set}
    g(X, Y) \equiv \sum_{(x, y) \in (X, Y)} g(x, y)
    \label{defn:function-on-arc-set}
\end{equation}

Similarly, when dealing with a function $h: N \rightarrow \R$ defined on
nodes, let:

\begin{equation}
    \tag{function on node-set}
    h(X) \equiv \sum_{x \in X} h(x)
\end{equation}

If we have $X, Y, Z \subseteq N$, then:
\begin{align*}
    &g(X, Y \cup Z) = g(X, Y) + g(X, Z) - g(X, Y \cap Z)  \\
    &g(Y \cup Z, X) = g(Y, X) + g(Z, X) - g(Y \cap Z, X)
\end{align*}

Notice that:

\begin{align*}
    &(B(x), x) = (N, x) \\
    &(x, A(x)) = (x, N) \\
\end{align*}

and:


\begin{align*}
      g(N, X) = \sum_{x \in X} g(N, x) = \sum_{x \in X} g(B(x), x) \\
      g(X, N) = \sum_{x \in X} g(x, N) = \sum_{x \in X} g(x, A(x))
\end{align*}
 

\section{Cuts}
%pg 21
Progress towards a solution of maximal network flow problems is made with the
recognition of the importance of certain subsets of arcs which we shall
call cuts.

\begin{definition}[Cut]
    A cut in $[N; A]$ separating $s$ and $t$ is a set of arcs $(X, \Xbar)$.
    The capacity of the cut is $c(X, \Xbar)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Every chain from $s$ to $t$ must contain some arc of every cut $(X, \Xbar)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be a chain with $x_1 = s, x_n = t$. Since $x_1 \in X$,
    $x_n \in \Xbar$, there must be some transitionary $x_i$ with $(1 \leq i \leq n)$ with
    $x_i \in X, x_{i+1} \in \Xbar$.  Hence the arc $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ is a 
    member of the cut $(X, \Xbar)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    If all arcs of a of a cut $(X, \Xbar)$ were deleted from the network, there would be no
    chain chain from $s$ to $t$, and the maximum flow value for the new network
    is zero.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Every chain from $s$ to $t$ must contain \emph{some} element of the
    arc $(X, \Xbar)$. We delete \emph{all} elements of the arc $(X, \Xbar)$.
    Hence no chain from $s$ to $t$ can exist; if it did, it would have some
    element of the arc $(X, \Xbar)$, which has been deleted.
\end{proof}

Since a cut blocks all chains from $s$ to $t$, it is intuitively clear
(and indeed obvious in the arc-chain version of the problem) that the value
$v$ of a flow $f$ cannot exceed the capacity of any cut, a fact that
we now prove.

\section{Flows and Cuts}
%22

\begin{lemma}
    Let $f$ be a flow from $s$ to $t$ in a network $[N; A]$. Let $f$ have
    value $v$. If $(X, \Xbar)$ is a cut separating $s$ and $t$, then

\begin{equation}
    \tag{Flow-Cut equality}
    v = f(X, \Xbar) - f(\Xbar, X) \leq c(X, \Xbar) 
    \label{eqn:flow-cut-equality}
\end{equation}

That is, the value of a flow $f$ from $s$ to $t$ is equal to the net flow
across any cut $(X, \Xbar)$ separating $s$ and $t$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $f$ is a flow, it satisfies the equations:

\begin{align*}
    &f(s, N) - f(N, s) = v \\
    &f(x, N) - f(N, x) = 0 \quad \{x \neq s, t\} \\
    &f(t, N) - f(N, t) = -v
\end{align*}

We first establish that $v = f(X, N) - f(N, X)$. To show this, we sum these
equations over $x \in X$. since $s \in X$, while $t \in \Xbar$ [hence $t \not \in X]$, we get:

\begin{align*}
    &f(X, N) - f(N, X) = \sum_{x \in X} f(x, N) - f(N, x)\\
    &= (f(s, N) - f(N, s)) + \sum_{x \in X, x \neq s} f(x, N) - f(N, x) \\
    &= v + \sum_{x \in X, x \neq s} 0 = v
\end{align*}

The above is reasonable. we have $s \in X$ contribute $v$ units. 
Since $t \not in X$, it cannot contribute to this sum. All other
$x \in X$ contribute $0$ units. Thus the total contribution is $v$.  Now, writing $N = X \cup \Xbar$ yields:

\begin{align*}
&v = f(X, N) - f(N, X) \quad \text{(From the above)} \\
&= f(X, X \cup \Xbar) - f(X \cup \Xbar, X) \\
&= f(X, X) + f(X, \Xbar) - f(X, X) - f(\Xbar, X) \\
&= f(X, \Xbar) - f(\Xbar, X)
\end{align*}

Finally, to show that this is upper bounded by capacity, recall that $0 \leq f(X, \Xbar) \leq c(X, \Xbar)$
by the definition of a valid flow, and the inequality follows.

\end{proof}
