\chapter{Cryptographic ideas}

We will talk about:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computational Difficutlty 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One way functions
    \item Hard core preidicates
    \end{itemize}

\item Computational Indistinguishability - Pseudorandom number generators.
\end{itemize}

\section{One way functions}
% \definition{$f: \{0, 1\}^* \to \{0, 1\}^*$ is said to be a \textbf{one way function} iff:}
$f: \{0, 1\}^* \to \{0, 1\}^*$ is said to be a \textbf{one way function} iff:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\exists$ DTM M which efficiently computes $f(x)$ for any $x$
\item $\forall~\pptm~A, \forall$ positive polynomials $p$, $P[A(f(x)) = y, f(y) = f(x)] < \frac{1}{p(|x|)}$
\end{itemize}

\section{PRNG (Pseudoranom number generator)}
An \textbf{efficient, deterministic} program $D$ (a \dtm), such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expansion: $D: \{0, 1\}^s \to \{0, 1\}^l;~l > s$
\item Pseudorandomness: No efficient distinguisher can distinguish between strings
randomly chosen from $\{0, 1\}^l$ and ones expanded from $D$:
$$\forall~\pptm~A, \bigg| P_{x \in \text{uniform}~\{0, 1\}^s}[A(D(x)=1] - P_{x\in \text{uniform}~\{0,1\}^l}[A(x)] \bigg| \leq negl(s)$$
\end{itemize}


\section{Three worlds}
\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithmica: $\ptime = \nptime$ (AI will flourish here)
\item Heuristica: $\ptime \neq \nptime$, but average case complexity of $\sat$ is polytime.
\item Pessiland: Average case hard problems exist, but there are no one-way functions \textit{(how?)}
(No NP-complete is efficiently learanble)

\item Minicrypt: One way functions exist, but Public-key-crypto isn't possible.
    (Many problems have lower bounds that we cannot learn it efficiently).
    (We can create hard problems, but not ones that are hard for everyone except us).

\item Cryptomania: Public key cryptography exists / trapdoor one way functions exist.
(We can easily create hard problems that is hard for everyone else but easy for us)
\end{itemize}
