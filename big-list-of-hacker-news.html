 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The road to hell is paved with good intentions <span class='centered'> I am a coloured South African(an ethnic group that was previously disadvantaged due to apartheid era racial policies) we in South Africa have Affirmative action policies called Black Economic Empower(BEE) (Its open to all previously advantaged racial groups ie Black, Coloured, Indian they just call it BEE) that has led to mass corruption and cronyism. <span class='centered'> >Start with crony capitalism, which in South Africa goes by the euphemism “black economic empowerment”. The idea behind it seemed laudable enough—to right a historical wrong. Under apartheid, the country produced white titans of industry such as the Oppenheimer family (owners of DeBeers), while making it hard for black South Africans to own businesses. The ANC(Ruling political party) felt it only fair that there should be black billionaires, too. To give them a leg-up it insisted that mining companies should hand at least 26% of their shares to the “historically disadvantaged”. Mining companies (as well as banks and insurers) did so willingly, diluting existing shareholdings when they transferred stakes to the likes of Cyril Ramaphosa, now the president, along with Patrice Motsepe, his brother-in-law, and Bridgette Radebe, his sister-in-law. [1 ] <span class='centered'> I and alot of South Africans could stomach a one-off payment or one-off percentage equity stake in firms(in South Africa the government instituted a policy that South African Corporate firms would sell shares preferential)to disadvantaged groups but after these shares were sold, the government wanted to continuously repeat it. <span class='centered'> >If these handouts had been a one-off tax, their harm would by now have been forgotten. But once the new black shareholders had sold their holdings, the government drafted regulations to repeat the process. And so capital investment in mines fell by 45% between 2010 and 2018, with output falling by 10% and employment by 50,000—a tenth of direct employment in the industry in 2010. [1 ] <span class='centered'> When the government gives support not based on merit and competence but gender, race, religion or ethnicity you undermine industrial policy(Instead of support based on a person's potential ability or ability to do things)With affirmative action you end up institutionalising incompetence. <span class='centered'> >Black Economic Empowerment, a policy that incentivises firms to give equity to black investors or business to black-owned suppliers, has created a new generation of Randlords with more political acumen than entrepreneurial talent. “Cadre deployment”, whereby ANC party(Ruling political party) members get jobs on the basis of factional fealty rather than merit, has degraded the state. These appointees steer contracts towards chosen “tenderpreneurs”, who in turn donate to the party. By 2007 Kgalema Motlanthe, a party grandee, said: “This rot is across the board...Almost every project is conceived because it offers opportunities for certain people to make money.” [2 ] <span class='centered'> Many South African feel that our counrty has become "a cappuccino society, A vast, huge, black majority at the bottom with a layer of white cream and a few chocolate sprinklings at the top of it" referring to the small black elite who have gained great riches from the post-apartheid years - from a failed attempt to rebalance the wealth among the many. <span class='centered'> Yes, I acknowledge the present-day inequities that racist, sexist, etc policies can cause, but if a Government was serious about addressing historical inequalities then you need to invest in education and skills development. Affirmative action never works in the long term, instead of making people competent and self-reliant,it makes them dependent on handouts. <span class='centered'> Contrast Taiwan and Malaysia's Industrial Policies and Outcomes <span class='centered'> Taiwan's has currently a healthy semiconductor industry with many successful and impressive firms ie TSMC, etc. <span class='centered'> And Malaysia with its affirmative action laws favouring certain ethnicities that ultimately undermined their industrial policies. The corruption and shenanigans that result from affirmative action policies happened in South Africa also happened in Malaysia and undermined their long term industrial goals. <span class='centered'> Appropriating a quote from Deng Xiaoping "It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice." This is taken to mean that as long as the economy works, it is a good economy. <span class='centered'> Affirmative action is equality of outcome. Do people think they have godly powers that can guarantee certain outcomes or results? There is an inherent risk of failure in all ventures and endeavours. <span class='centered'> A correct criticism of capitalism is when it does not provide equal opportunity and so we should always strive to provide equal opportunity, but people confuse that with the equal outcome when, equal outcome can only be enforced through violence because different people, free people make different choices and when they make different choices they have different outcomes if you don't let them suffer the consequences of bad choices or reap the rewards from good choices then you have to use force or violence to get a prefered outcome <span class='centered'> If people are really serious about freedom and equality then you should want not just the freedom to succeed, but also the freedom to fail. <span class='centered'>  [1 ]https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/07/24/end-of-the-line... <span class='centered'>  [2 ]https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/24/... </blockquote>

She said, now you get it, how much did <span class='centered'> they offer. I told her, and she said I will double that if you stay. </blockquote>

 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Social justice and "fairness" is rarely one of the main goals of a <span class='centered'> meritocracy. The main goal of a meritocracy is peak performance. NFL teams <span class='centered'> select the "best" quarter-backs not because it's most fair, but because it <span class='centered'> will produce the most wins. Universities grant tenure to the most productive <span class='centered'> professors, because that will enhance the University's reputation. Hospitals <span class='centered'> hire the best doctors, because they can save the most lives. A society should <span class='centered'> delegate its most important responsibilities to its smartest/most-knowledgable <span class='centered'> members, because they can best lead society through worldly challenges. <span class='centered'>  <span class='centered'> Which is not to say that Social Justice isn't important. It is vital. But you <span class='centered'> don't get to it by hiring the wrong people in the wrong roles. A meritocracy <span class='centered'> excels at producing wealth - Universal Basic Income, Universal Healthcare, <span class='centered'> Unemployment Insurance, better Public Schooling... these are the kind of Social <span class='centered'> Justice programs that best distribute the wealth back to society. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> my only other critique, which is good in general, but try to force yourself to </blockquote>
 <span class='centered'>speak slower than you want to.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> taking time to build a diagram is the best way to convey knowledge </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> learning to be comfortable with silences while speaking doesn't come naturally to anyone. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Some kids grow up on football. I grew up on public speaking (as behavioral <span class='centered'> therapy for a speech impediment, actually). If you want to get radically better <span class='centered'> in a hurry: 1) If you ever find yourself buffering on output, rather than <span class='centered'> making hesitation noises, just pause. People will read that as considered <span class='centered'> deliberation and intelligence. It's outrageously more effective than the <span class='centered'> equivalent amount of emm, aww, like, etc. Practice saying nothing.  Nothing is <span class='centered'> often the best possible thing to say. (A great time to say nothing: during <span class='centered'> applause or laughter.) 2) People remember voice a heck of a lot more than they <span class='centered'> remember content. Not vocal voice, but your authorial voice, the sort of thing <span class='centered'> English teachers teach you to detect in written documents. After you have found <span class='centered'> a voice which works for you and your typical audiences, you can exploit it to <span class='centered'> the hilt.  I have basically one way to start speeches: with a self-deprecating <span class='centered'> joke. It almost always gets a laugh out of the crowd, and I can't be nervous <span class='centered'> when people are laughing with me, so that helps break the ice and warm us into <span class='centered'> the main topic.  3) Posture hacks: if you're addressing any group of people <span class='centered'> larger than a dinner table, pick three people in the left, middle, and right of <span class='centered'> the crowd. Those three people are your new best friends, who have come to hear <span class='centered'> you talk but for some strange reason are surrounded by great masses of mammals <span class='centered'> who are uninvolved in the speech. Funny that. Rotate eye contact over your <span class='centered'> three best friends as you talk, at whatever a natural pace would be for you. <span class='centered'> (If you don't know what a natural pace is, two sentences or so works for me to <span class='centered'> a first approximation.) Everyone in the audience -- both your friends and the <span class='centered'> uninvolved mammals -- will perceive that you are looking directly at them for <span class='centered'> enough of the speech to feel flattered but not quite enough to feel creepy.  4) <span class='centered'> Podiums were invented by some sadist who hates introverts. Don't give him the <span class='centered'> satisfaction. Speak from a vantage point where the crowd can see your entire <span class='centered'> body.  5) Hands: pockets, no, pens, no, fidgeting, no. Gestures, yes. If you <span class='centered'> don't have enough gross motor control to talk and gesture at the same time (no <span class='centered'> joke, this was once a problem for me) then having them in a neutral position in <span class='centered'> front of your body works well.  6) Many people have different thoughts on the <span class='centered'> level of preparation or memorization which is required. In general, having <span class='centered'> strong control of the narrative structure of your speech without being wedded <span class='centered'> to the exact ordering of sentences is a good balance for most people. (The fact <span class='centered'> that you're coming to the conclusion shouldn't surprise you.) 7) If you <span class='centered'> remember nothing else on microtactical phrasing when you're up there, remember <span class='centered'> that most people do not naturally include enough transition words when speaking <span class='centered'> informally, which tends to make speeches loose narrative cohesion. Throw in a <span class='centered'> few more than you would ordinarily think to do.  </blockquote>
