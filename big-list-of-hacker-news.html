That I had been<span class='centered'> conditioned thru my childhood to think like a poor person and in doing so you<span class='centered'> send out unconscious signals to others. She told me this because she came up<span class='centered'> similar. She told me that it causes you to over analyze and over estimate<span class='centered'> risk and therefore you will not take the bold moves that people that don't<span class='centered'> have to worry do. That while you can change the world and everyone see it. If<span class='centered'> you hold onto the fear on meeting your net under you, that you will never<span class='centered'> extract your true value from other. So I said, so you are going to pay me my<span class='centered'> fair value, she laughed and said no, I got you for a very good deal. 3 Days<span class='centered'> latter I walked into her office, with my resignation letter and told her I<span class='centered'> had an offer from another company. She said, now you get it, how much did<span class='centered'> they offer. I told her, and she said I will double that if you stay.</blockquote>

But worse would be to find 1/2 a worm, worse still 1/4 of<span class='centered'> a worm, etc... continuity would imply the worst case scenario is biting into<span class='centered'> an apple and not finding a worm.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class='centered'> Mona Lisa was special in part because it was uncommon for people to smile. In<span class='centered'> Middle Ages, someone smiling a lot would be perceived as stupid. That's why<span class='centered'> facial expressions in medieval imagery are so serious. Today, being surprised<span class='centered'> a lot is often taken as a sign of stupidity, whereas in ancient Greece an owl<span class='centered'> was the bird of Athena, the goddess of wisdom. Because, obviously, an owl is<span class='centered'> always surprised, and surprise is the first step to understanding.</blockquote>
