 <span class='centered'> "Thus, we know that  <code class='inline'>pr-ty</code> lives in UNIV because of correctness of  <code class='inline'>synth</code>" into 
 <span class='centered'> "Correctness of  <code class='inline'>synth</code> guarantees that  <code class='inline'>pr-ty</code> lives in UNIV".  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> There is low satisfaction of finishing and understanding a section, it seems </blockquote>

 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Align figures to either all left or all right. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> In structure, label references to future sections are non existent, so it </blockquote>
 <span class='centered'>  would help assure the reader in section x that you will talk more about the 
 <span class='centered'>  uses of this in section y.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> What do you have in mind? works well to get to know what the other person </blockquote>
 <span class='centered'>   would like.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> So the way I see it, is that as soon as you are </blockquote>
 <span class='centered'>  naming something, people may ask things like "What 
 <span class='centered'>  is X exactly? What is X composed of?". So I can 
 <span class='centered'>  clearly see reviewers ask "What is DSL composed 
 <span class='centered'>  of?", but if we wouldn't name it, I wouldn't expect 
 <span class='centered'>  reviewers to ask "What is the python interface composed of?"  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> She told me that I was what she calls institutionally poor. That I had been <span class='centered'> conditioned thru my childhood to think like a poor person and in doing so you <span class='centered'> send out unconscious signals to others. She told me this because she came up <span class='centered'> similar. She told me that it causes you to over analyze and over estimate <span class='centered'> risk and therefore you will not take the bold moves that people that don't <span class='centered'> have to worry do. That while you can change the world and everyone see it. If <span class='centered'> you hold onto the fear on meeting your net under you, that you will never <span class='centered'> extract your true value from other. So I said, so you are going to pay me my <span class='centered'> fair value, she laughed and said no, I got you for a very good deal. 3 Days <span class='centered'> latter I walked into her office, with my resignation letter and told her I <span class='centered'> had an offer from another company. She said, now you get it, how much did <span class='centered'> they offer. I told her, and she said I will double that if you stay. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Here's a discontinuity irl that I read about: you bite into an apple and find <span class='centered'> a worm. Disgusting. But worse would be to find 1/2 a worm, worse still 1/4 of <span class='centered'> a worm, etc... continuity would imply the worst case scenario is biting into <span class='centered'> an apple and not finding a worm. </blockquote>

 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Mona Lisa was special in part because it was uncommon for people to smile. In <span class='centered'> Middle Ages, someone smiling a lot would be perceived as stupid. That's why <span class='centered'> facial expressions in medieval imagery are so serious. Today, being surprised <span class='centered'> a lot is often taken as a sign of stupidity, whereas in ancient Greece an owl <span class='centered'> was the bird of Athena, the goddess of wisdom. Because, obviously, an owl is <span class='centered'> always surprised, and surprise is the first step to understanding. </blockquote>

 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Social justice and "fairness" is rarely one of the main goals of a <span class='centered'> meritocracy. The main goal of a meritocracy is peak performance. NFL teams <span class='centered'> select the "best" quarter-backs not because it's most fair, but because it <span class='centered'> will produce the most wins. Universities grant tenure to the most productive <span class='centered'> professors, because that will enhance the University's reputation. Hospitals <span class='centered'> hire the best doctors, because they can save the most lives. A society should <span class='centered'> delegate its most important responsibilities to its smartest/most-knowledgable <span class='centered'> members, because they can best lead society through worldly challenges. <span class='centered'>  <span class='centered'> Which is not to say that Social Justice isn't important. It is vital. But you <span class='centered'> don't get to it by hiring the wrong people in the wrong roles. A meritocracy <span class='centered'> excels at producing wealth - Universal Basic Income, Universal Healthcare, <span class='centered'> Unemployment Insurance, better Public Schooling... these are the kind of Social <span class='centered'> Justice programs that best distribute the wealth back to society. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> my only other critique, which is good in general, but try to force yourself to </blockquote>
 <span class='centered'>speak slower than you want to.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> taking time to build a diagram is the best way to convey knowledge </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> learning to be comfortable with silences while speaking doesn't come naturally to anyone. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Some kids grow up on football. I grew up on public speaking (as behavioral <span class='centered'> therapy for a speech impediment, actually). If you want to get radically better <span class='centered'> in a hurry: 1) If you ever find yourself buffering on output, rather than <span class='centered'> making hesitation noises, just pause. People will read that as considered <span class='centered'> deliberation and intelligence. It's outrageously more effective than the <span class='centered'> equivalent amount of emm, aww, like, etc. Practice saying nothing.  Nothing is <span class='centered'> often the best possible thing to say. (A great time to say nothing: during <span class='centered'> applause or laughter.) 2) People remember voice a heck of a lot more than they <span class='centered'> remember content. Not vocal voice, but your authorial voice, the sort of thing <span class='centered'> English teachers teach you to detect in written documents. After you have found <span class='centered'> a voice which works for you and your typical audiences, you can exploit it to <span class='centered'> the hilt.  I have basically one way to start speeches: with a self-deprecating <span class='centered'> joke. It almost always gets a laugh out of the crowd, and I can't be nervous <span class='centered'> when people are laughing with me, so that helps break the ice and warm us into <span class='centered'> the main topic.  3) Posture hacks: if you're addressing any group of people <span class='centered'> larger than a dinner table, pick three people in the left, middle, and right of <span class='centered'> the crowd. Those three people are your new best friends, who have come to hear <span class='centered'> you talk but for some strange reason are surrounded by great masses of mammals <span class='centered'> who are uninvolved in the speech. Funny that. Rotate eye contact over your <span class='centered'> three best friends as you talk, at whatever a natural pace would be for you. <span class='centered'> (If you don't know what a natural pace is, two sentences or so works for me to <span class='centered'> a first approximation.) Everyone in the audience -- both your friends and the <span class='centered'> uninvolved mammals -- will perceive that you are looking directly at them for <span class='centered'> enough of the speech to feel flattered but not quite enough to feel creepy.  4) <span class='centered'> Podiums were invented by some sadist who hates introverts. Don't give him the <span class='centered'> satisfaction. Speak from a vantage point where the crowd can see your entire <span class='centered'> body.  5) Hands: pockets, no, pens, no, fidgeting, no. Gestures, yes. If you <span class='centered'> don't have enough gross motor control to talk and gesture at the same time (no <span class='centered'> joke, this was once a problem for me) then having them in a neutral position in <span class='centered'> front of your body works well.  6) Many people have different thoughts on the <span class='centered'> level of preparation or memorization which is required. In general, having <span class='centered'> strong control of the narrative structure of your speech without being wedded <span class='centered'> to the exact ordering of sentences is a good balance for most people. (The fact <span class='centered'> that you're coming to the conclusion shouldn't surprise you.) 7) If you <span class='centered'> remember nothing else on microtactical phrasing when you're up there, remember <span class='centered'> that most people do not naturally include enough transition words when speaking <span class='centered'> informally, which tends to make speeches loose narrative cohesion. Throw in a <span class='centered'> few more than you would ordinarily think to do.  </blockquote>
