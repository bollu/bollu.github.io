 <span class='centered'>Alok Debnath, a friend of mine claims he understood "how I read" based on 
 <span class='centered'>reading infinite jest and setting me experiments that allowed him to observe 
 <span class='centered'>how I read.  
 <span class='centered'>In his words:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Alok: I have seen you spasm on your cursor trying to read text (TODO: get a longer <span class='centered'> quote form alok about what this means) </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>He said that he never understood what the fuck I was doing until he read 
 <span class='centered'>Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (a phenomenal book, I loved it and recommended it to him, 
 <span class='centered'>which were enough recommendations to get him to read it, it seems).  
 <h4><a id=infinite-jest href='#infinite-jest'> § </a><span class='centered'> Infinite jest </h4> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Alok: It took me reading that book twice to understand how you process text. <span class='centered'> Let's deep dive.  You don't read sentences, from what I remember. You have a <span class='centered'> different model of chunking text.  For what it's worth, I tried to remember <span class='centered'> what you spasm between when skimming vs when reading. There does not seem to <span class='centered'> be much difference between those modes for you, which was interesting. So I <span class='centered'> tried to note why you would sometimes go BACK rather than read sentence to <span class='centered'> sentence. I figured it was one of three things: </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>The three things are:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 1. You went from verb to verb or action to action, or event to event, and <span class='centered'>   then determined the significance of that event. You would move backwards <span class='centered'>   only if the verb was significant enough to warrant its arguments being <span class='centered'>   understood <span class='centered'> 2. You went from topic to topic, and would only go BACK if you think you <span class='centered'>    missed a timestep in the movement between topics. <span class='centered'> 3. You read from line to line, regardless of the sentence, phrase, clause or <span class='centered'>    syntactic structure, and would only go back if an item caught your <span class='centered'>    attention. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>According to him, I do a combination of 1 and 2, in contrast to others who 
 <span class='centered'>might do (3).  
 <h4><a id=why-this-works-for-me href='#why-this-works-for-me'> § </a><span class='centered'> Why this works for me </h4> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> you are uniquely adaptive to reading style, based on very little information. <span class='centered'> This is a good thing when there is a unique, singular style to the entire <span class='centered'> article, it is easy to templatize and then retrofit into how you want to get <span class='centered'> that information. </blockquote> 
 <h4><a id=his-take-on-my-take-on-why-sep-is-trash href='#his-take-on-my-take-on-why-sep-is-trash'> § </a><span class='centered'> His take on my take on why SEP is trash </h4> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> I ran a series of experiments to figure this out. I'd ask you to read a <span class='centered'> paper, a textbook chapter or something in front of me, and after you'd read a <span class='centered'> paragraph, ask you to explain it. Some times you were already reading <span class='centered'> something (mostly philosophy related) and that's ambush.  Lastly, I used SEP as <span class='centered'> bait .SEP has not been written for people like you. And I was thoroughly <span class='centered'> surprised at your vehement disapproval to some of the articles <span class='centered'> (for their content ofc), but your veiled stylistic inputs as well. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> you mentioned that the text  <a href=><span class='centered'>of the SEP article on Derrida </a> was malformed, <span class='centered'> which is a stylistic input, rather than a content issue. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>He figured out that the SEP entry has been written in two merged styles - one is 
 <span class='centered'>a list of topics that Derrida talks about The other is a list of events which 
 <span class='centered'>weave together how those topics became tenets of his philosophy.  The style of 
 <span class='centered'>writing generally based on the modern notion of "set-inductive" introductions 
 <span class='centered'>to topics Which doesn't work well with you. Because I then noticed how you read 
 <span class='centered'>code And I figured that you need to have a trace of the topics talked about in 
 <span class='centered'>case they appear again in the code, and you parse blocks, retrieve need, GC, 
 <span class='centered'>and move on to the next block. So order of arguments and the state of these 
 <span class='centered'>topics remains in your mind, along with significant events. 
 <span class='centered'>debnatak: You read text in a similar way, which is why set inductive writing is 
 <span class='centered'>the worst way to write for you.  
 <h4><a id=inductive-writing href='#inductive-writing'> § </a><span class='centered'> Inductive writing </h4>
 <span class='centered'> Apparently, this is a common philosophy of teaching where one is exposed 
 <span class='centered'>to a topic by "forewarning" them of all the subtopics, then a narrative is 
 <span class='centered'>weaved exploring the relationship between each subtopic, explaining them as 
 <span class='centered'>they come.  It's the style in which school textbooks are written.  So it is 
 <span class='centered'>neither ordered by event, nor ordered by topic. It's the job of the teacher to 
 <span class='centered'>guide the student across the text.  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Now, the Derrida SEP article is written in a very similar manner, albeit a <span class='centered'> bit more well formed in narrative The text is not written in a manner where <span class='centered'> you can parse things by topic(i.e.  first deconstructionism, then <span class='centered'> universality, then sovereignty) or by event (publishing book1 , then 2, then <span class='centered'> 3 or whatever). Therefore, this writing style is completely adverserial to <span class='centered'> your reading style! </blockquote> 
 <h4><a id=why-i-enjoy-dfw-and-infinite-jest href='#why-i-enjoy-dfw-and-infinite-jest'> § </a><span class='centered'> Why I enjoy DFW and infinite jest </h4> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Infinite Jest, and DFW in general, clearly does not write like this. It is the antithesis, almost <span class='centered'> Your insane experience in garbage collection works when there are a large <span class='centered'> number of interconnected stories, people and threads being referenced in the <span class='centered'> same sentence.Given that you chunk differently, parse differently, and <span class='centered'> organise mental notes on what you have read differently than I do, it is not <span class='centered'> surprising that you understood DFW fairly well. <span class='centered'> DFWs writing style almost wholeheartedly abandons prescriptivist notions of <span class='centered'> punctuation and syntactic structure beyond the meager subject verb agreement, <span class='centered'> Which I think is also abandoned in some monologues. <span class='centered'> That would not be a large issue for someone who does not use punctuation as a <span class='centered'> mechanism of parsing sentence information, or even as an anchor of "begin <span class='centered'> here" and "end here". </blockquote> 
 <h4><a id=inference-from-me-reading-code href='#inference-from-me-reading-code'> § </a><span class='centered'> Inference from me reading code? </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>According to him, this is similar to how I read code:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> I saw you read word2vec.c in front of me And I was mindfucked at how you <span class='centered'> abstract information on the go Like you read bracket to bracket (I think), <span class='centered'> and keep track of "important" variables, especially function arguments and <span class='centered'> return values, and just summarize the rest debnatak: Not every operation <span class='centered'> needs to be understood, of course. But it is noted regardless. Functions are <span class='centered'> skipped over if not called, variables are ignored if not used.  debnatak: You <span class='centered'> were never confused about the program flow debnatak: Idk, it seemed clean for <span class='centered'> code, and math ofc because representations </blockquote>
