The goal of this side project is to create beautiful rendering of ideas
in differential geometry which enchant me. So I hope to have renderings
of homology, cohomology, exterior calculus, the laplace operator, the heat 
equation, the wave equation, curvature, and holonomy. 

While I'm at it, I plan to steal ideas and javascript from
[observableHQ](https://observablehq.com/), whom I deeply admire.
