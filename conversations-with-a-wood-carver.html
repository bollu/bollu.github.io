 <span class='centered'>There's a wood carver who lives close to home, whose name is Harish. 
 <span class='centered'>I went to speak to him, asking if he would be willing to teach me woodcarving. 
 <span class='centered'>It was a very interesting converstaion.  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> He argued that wood carving was his caste, and it was impossible for him <span class='centered'>to teach me this, since he learnt it "by practice from birth". </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> He also mentioned that his skills were learnt by practice, and not through <span class='centered'>training and were thus un-teachable. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> He felt that it was impossible to pick up the skill anymore since I ddn't <span class='centered'>learn it as a kid. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> His feeling is that the art of wood carving is not respected, and it makes <span class='centered'>much more sense to go learn how to use a CNC . </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> We spoke about how the traditional style of woodcarving provided more  <span class='centered'>control, and led to better construction. He said that consumers don't care, <span class='centered'>and resent him for the extra time. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> He oft repeated how he was poor; He wakes up in the morning, takes care  <span class='centered'>of his cows, then begins carving. He might stay up late if there's an urgent <span class='centered'>order. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> None of his children learnt woodcarving either. They seem to be learning <span class='centered'>things like commerce and graphic design. It seems likely that woodcarving <span class='centered'>will die with him. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> He also mentioned how he no longer carves for the local temples, who one would <span class='centered'>expect would be his largest customer base since he specializes in carving <span class='centered'>paraphranelia for idols. It turns out that temples only provide "blessings", <span class='centered'>and no payment. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> When carving beds for gods, one must arrange the bed to be along the natural <span class='centered'>direction of the tree. The feed of the god must be in the direction of the  <span class='centered'>roots, and the head must be towards the sky. Otherwise, the god will not <span class='centered'>accept the tree. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Towards this, there are many interesting principles of how to learn the <span class='centered'>direction of wood. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> For one, one can use knots in the wood to identify the <span class='centered'>direction of growth.  See the knot in the front and back of a block of wood. <span class='centered'>There will be a directionality to this knot. See that branches grow from low <span class='centered'>to high; So the knot indicates the direction of growth of the tree. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> For another, we can cut a think horizontal slice from the block of wood. <span class='centered'>In the two halves, the splinters will "point upwards" in the slice. </li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>In general, this conversation left me quite dejected about the state of arts 
 <span class='centered'>in India. It seems like traditional carpentry in India is dead, and the 
 <span class='centered'>"replacements" are of terrible quality. I was also saddened that he so adamantly 
 <span class='centered'>believes that it is fundamentally impossible for people to learn carpentry.
