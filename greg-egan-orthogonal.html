 <span class='centered'>I found the idea of writing a story about a universe with a closed loop of time fascinating. 
 <span class='centered'>Here are some of the sentences that really helped me "get" compatiblism as an idea thanks 
 <span class='centered'>to reading the book:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Suppose we leave a piece of equipment behind on Esilio - say, a <span class='centered'> small spyglass. Over the eons, from our point of view, we'd expect it to become <span class='centered'> pitted by dust in the wind, and eventually break up completely and turn to <span class='centered'> sand. Our spyglass, our rules: that sounds fair, doesn't it? But if that sand <span class='centered'> stays on Esilio, what origin will it have from Esilio's point of view? Most <span class='centered'> likely, some ordinary Esilian rock will have broken down to make it - which to <span class='centered'> us, would look like erosion running backwards. But then, in Esilian time the <span class='centered'> remnants of that rock will eventually form themselves spontaneously into a <span class='centered'> spyglass, which lies on the ground until we come along to retrieve it.  So if <span class='centered'> you follow the history of the matter that makes up the spyglass far enough in <span class='centered'> both directions, it's clear that it's not committed to either side's rdes.'  <span class='centered'>  <span class='centered'> 'Swap the roles of Esilio and the Surveyor,' he replied, 'then tell the same <span class='centered'> story again. If something from Esilio takes the place of the spyglass, it must <span class='centered'> be with us already. We must have been carrying it, or the things that will <span class='centered'> become it, from the very start. Because according to Esilio's arrow of time <span class='centered'> we've already visited the planet, and it's almost certain that something <span class='centered'> remained with us when we departed.' </blockquote>
 <span class='centered'>   
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'Tell us one thing that you're sure won't happen,' he challenged her.  She <span class='centered'> said, 'Two objects in thermal contact will not maintain different <span class='centered'> temperatures over a long period of time.' 'Because ... ?' 'Because there are <span class='centered'> vastly more possibilities in which they share their thermal energy more <span class='centered'> equally. If you pick a possibility at random, it's likely to be one of those. <span class='centered'> Fundamental physics might make the entropy minimum necessary - but we still <span class='centered'> expect the cosmos to be as random as it can be.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> There was fine red dust covering the grey hardstone walls of the airlock. He <span class='centered'> hadn't noticed it by the dimmer illumination of the safety light. He ran a <span class='centered'> gloved finger along the seal of the outer door, trying to find the point <span class='centered'> where it had been breached, but if there was a hole it wasn't apparent.  It <span class='centered'> hardly mattered now; however the dust had entered, he was about to let in a <span class='centered'> great deal more. But as he began to turn the crank, the realisation hit him: <span class='centered'> it hadn't corne from outside. They must have brought it with them all the way <span class='centered'> from the Peerless, scattered invisibly throughout the craft, with a little <span class='centered'> more accumulating inside the airlock each time the inner door was opened. Or <span class='centered'> in Esilio's terms: the Surveyor's visit had just ended, and this residue was <span class='centered'> something they would soon take away with them </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Twice, as she jumped out of some indentation in the sand, it vanished. She <span class='centered'> and Azelio hadn't actually made all the tracks that he'd attributed to them. <span class='centered'> Or not yet, they hadn't.  'Come and join us,' Azelio said. 'Some of these <span class='centered'> must be yours.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Each time Azelio lifted his feet, scattered sand unscattered itself, grains <span class='centered'> sliding in around the places where he'd stepped to settle more evenly - <span class='centered'> though not always smoothing the ground completely. After all, 197 Ramiro <span class='centered'> reasoned, it was possible to walk in someone else's footprints, or to step <span class='centered'> several times in your own. It would only be the last footfall on any given <span class='centered'> spot - prior to the next occasion on which the wind levelled everything - <span class='centered'> that would unmake the imprint completely. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'What happens if I try to walk on pristine ground?' he asked.  'Try it and <span class='centered'> see!' Agata taunted him.  Ramiro descended to the bottom of the ladder, <span class='centered'> intending to move quickly and get the ordeal over with, but then his resolve <span class='centered'> deserted him. When he willed his foot to land on unblemished sand, what <span class='centered'> exactly would intervene to stop him? A cramp in the muscle, diverting his leg <span class='centered'> to its proper, predestined target? A puppet-like manipulation of his body by <span class='centered'> some unseen force too strong to resist, or a trance-like suspension of his <span class='centered'> whole sense of self? He wasn't sure that he wanted to know the answer. And <span class='centered'> perhaps that was the simplest resolution: he would lack the courage to walk <span class='centered'> out across the surface of Esilio for the rest of the mission. He would cower <span class='centered'> in his room, leaving the work to the others, while he waited to return to the <span class='centered'> Peerless in disgrace. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> He'd scrutinised the ground beforehand, and he was sure there'd been no <span class='centered'> footprints at all where his feet now stood.  He lifted one foot and inspected <span class='centered'> the sand below. He had created an indentation that had not been there before. <span class='centered'> That was every bit as strange to Esilio as the erasures he'd witnessed were <span class='centered'> strange to him. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'>'How?' he demanded, more confused than relieved.  'You <span class='centered'> really don't listen to me, do you?' Agata chided him. 'Did I ever tell you <span class='centered'> that the local arrow was inviolable? 'No.' What she'd stressed most of all <span class='centered'> was a loss of predictability but the sight of her and Azelio unmaking their <span class='centered'> footprints had crowded everything else out of his mind. Those disappearing <span class='centered'> marks 198 in the sand might be unsettling, but if he could ignore them and <span class='centered'> walk wherever he pleased then they were not the shackles he'd taken them to <span class='centered'> be.   </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'What happens if there are footprints that no one gets around to <span class='centered'> before the next dust storm?' he asked Agata. 'Ones that were there <span class='centered'> straight after the last storm?' <span class='centered'> She said, 'There can't be a footprint untouched by any foot. I don't <span class='centered'> understand the dynamics of wind and sand well enough to swear to <span class='centered'> you that there won't be hollows in the ground that come and go of <span class='centered'> their own accord - but if you're talking about a clear imprint, if we <span class='centered'> could keep our feet away from it, it simply wouldn't be there.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Esilio was a world where a certain amount of nOiSY, partial - and <span class='centered'> predominantly trivial - information about the future would be strewn across <span class='centered'> the landscape. There had always been plenty of trivial things that could be <span class='centered'> predicted with near-certainty back on the Peerless, and perhaps as many of <span class='centered'> them would be lost, here, as these eerie new portents would be gained </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Emboldened, he strode out across the illuminated ground, pausing <span class='centered'> every few steps to kick at the sand. Sometimes he simply pushed the <span class='centered'> dust aside; sometimes the dust applied pressure of its own, as it <span class='centered'> moved in to occupy the space his foot vacated. But that pressure <span class='centered'> never came out of nowhere: his feet moved as and when he'd willed <span class='centered'> them to move, followed by the dust but never forced to retreat. Nor <span class='centered'> were they thrust without warning into the air </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Each time there was a dust storm the record of future movements would be <span class='centered'> erased, but even in a prolonged period of calm the footprints would overlap, <span class='centered'> conveying very little information. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'You already dug twelve holes!' he observed. <span class='centered'> 'And I thought you were messing around with Agata all morning.' <span class='centered'> Azelio made a noncommittal sound.  <span class='centered'> 'My plan is to dig up all these plants at the end of the trial and take <span class='centered'> them back to the Peerless for my colleagues to analyse,' Azelio mused.  'So I <span class='centered'> guess that's when I'll see the transition between cultivated and truly <span class='centered'> pristine ground. But right now, in Esilio's terms, we've just dug the plants <span class='centered'> up - so on our terms, we're about to do that. Backwards.' Ramiro said, 'You <span class='centered'> make it sound as if you've been practising timereversed agronomy all your <span class='centered'> life.' 'It's not that hard to see what's going on, if you think it through,' <span class='centered'> Azelio replied lightly.  'But you don't mind following markers like this? <span class='centered'> Evidence of acts you haven't performed yet?' 'It's a little disconcerting,' <span class='centered'> Azelio conceded. 'But I can't say that it fills me with claustrophobia to <span class='centered'> know that I'll carry out the experimental protocols I always planned to carry <span class='centered'> out.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> He lowered the plant until its roots were in the hole, then <span class='centered'> he started adding soil from the surrounding mound. Some of the soil <span class='centered'> was scooped in with pressure from behind, in the ordinary manner. <span class='centered'> Some appeared to pursue the trowel, the way the dust sometimes <span class='centered'> pursued Ramiro's feet. What decided between the two? Azelio's own <span class='centered'> actions had to be consistent with the motion of the soil, but which <span class='centered'> determined which? Maybe there was no answer to that, short of the <span class='centered'> impossible act of solving in the finest detail the equations that Agata <span class='centered'> was yet to discover, revealing exactly which sequences of events <span class='centered'> were consistent with the laws of physics all the way around the <span class='centered'> cosmos.  </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Ramiro's left arm had grown tired from holding the plant in place over the <span class='centered'> hole. He shifted it slightly to make himself more comfortable, but as he <span class='centered'> shifted it back he saw soil rising and adhering to the roots. He stared at <span class='centered'> this bizarre result for a moment, then decided to stop wasting time delaying <span class='centered'> an outcome he had no wish to oppose.  He held the trowel to the side of the <span class='centered'> mound nearest the hole, then drew it closer. The sand followed the blade - <span class='centered'> not adhering to it and needing to be brought along, but gently pushing it. He <span class='centered'> lowered the trowel into the hole then withdrew it; the sand parted from the <span class='centered'> blade and packed itself between the roots of the plant and the side of the <span class='centered'> hole. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> He hesitated, groping for a clearer sense of his role in the task. But <span class='centered'> what could he actually do wrong? So long as he was committed to <span class='centered'> making whatever movements with the trowel were necessary until <span class='centered'> the plant was securely in place, that state of mind and the strictures <span class='centered'> of the environment ought to work it out between themselves. <span class='centered'> He scooped some soil straight into the hole; like the last delivery, it <span class='centered'> clung to the roots. In Esilio's terms, this soil had spent at least a few <span class='centered'> stints packed tightly around the plant; if he could have seen the <span class='centered'> action in reverse, it would have involved nothing stranger than a <span class='centered'> clump of sand finally coming loose.  </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> But as she moved the broom across the floor, duly concentrating the dust <span class='centered'> ahead of it, other dust began to appear behind it - some of it falling from <span class='centered'> the air, some sliding over the stone to pile up against the bristles. Its <span class='centered'> entropy was decreasing too, as it accumulated from whatever scattered reaches <span class='centered'> of the Surveyor in which it had been lurking.  The net result was that the <span class='centered'> stretch of floor she'd swept remained as dusty as ever. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> But the plants' uptake of nutrients relied on interactions <span class='centered'> between their roots and the native soil at a microscopic level, and <span class='centered'> there was no guarantee that the two systems, left to themselves, <span class='centered'> would simply sort out their differences </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'Because the test plots are failing,' Agata explained. 'So we need <span class='centered'> to take the explosive up into the hills, turn some rock into soil for <span class='centered'> ourselves - against the Esilian arrow - and see if that imbues the soil <span class='centered'> with the properties that it needs to support plant growth </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'If we do set off this <span class='centered'> explosive,' he reasoned, 'shouldn't we be able to see some evidence of <span class='centered'> that already?' <span class='centered'> Agata said, 'You mean a crater?' <span class='centered'> 'Yes.' <span class='centered'> 'If we found a site like that, it would be useless to us. It would imply <span class='centered'> that after we set off the bomb, the crater would be gone and the sand <span class='centered'> around it would be rock again.' <span class='centered'> Ramiro scowled. 'Esilio doesn't care what's useful or useless, or it <span class='centered'> wouldn't have killed the plants, would it?' <span class='centered'> 'Esilio doesn't care,' Agata agreed, 'but why would we go ahead and <span class='centered'> set off the bomb there, knowing that it would do us no good?' <span class='centered'> 'Because the crater would prove that we did!' Ramiro replied heatedly. <span class='centered'> 'But as far as we know, there is no such crater.' Agata met his gaze <span class='centered'> openly, trying to reassure him of her Sincerity: she wasn't playing <span class='centered'> some verbal game just to annoy him. 'There is no crater, because if <span class='centered'> we saw it, we wouldn't choose to make it. Esilio can't force our hand; <span class='centered'> whatever happens has to be consistent with everything, including <span class='centered'> our motives. Ramiro said, 'It can't force our hand, but there could still be an <span class='centered'> accident.' 'That's true. But if we saw such a crater, we wouldn't even go near it <span class='centered'> with the explosive.'  </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> He ran a hand over his face. 'If the plants can't <span class='centered'> bring their arrow to Esilio, why should a bomb do any better?' <span class='centered'> 'The roots of a plant aren't entirely passive,' Azelio replied, 'but <span class='centered'> they do rely on the state of the soil. I don't think the bomb going off <span class='centered'> will rely on anything like that.' <span class='centered'> 'But in Esilian time,' Ramiro protested, 'all the soil we're supposedly going to make with this bomb has to mesh perfectly with a <span class='centered'> backwards explOSion in such a way that it forms a solid rock. How <span class='centered'> likely is that?'  <span class='centered'> How likely are the alternatives?' Agata countered. 'How likely is <span class='centered'> it that the explOSive will fail to detonate? How likely is it that we'll <span class='centered'> allow it to explode in an existing crater instead - just to pander to <span class='centered'> Esilio's arrow?' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> She started swinging her pick into the rock face. <span class='centered'> Small chips of stone flew out from the point of impact, stinging her <span class='centered'> forearms, but the rush of power and freedom she felt at the sight of <span class='centered'> the growing excavation was more than enough to compensate. <span class='centered'> In Esilian time, the chips were rising from the ground, propelled into <span class='centered'> the air by conspiracies of time-reversed thermal diffusion, just to aid <span class='centered'> her as she rebuilt the rock. What stronger proof could there be that <span class='centered'> the cosmos had a place for her, with all her plans and choices? One <span class='centered'> day it would kill her, but until then the contract was clear: hardship <span class='centered'> and frustration and failure were all pOSSible, but she would never be <span class='centered'> robbed of her will entirely. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> the lines on the <span class='centered'> rock face formed symbols. The sides of the ridges appeared softened <span class='centered'> and eroded, as if a generation's worth of future dust storms had left <span class='centered'> their mark. But she could still make out most of the message. <span class='centered'> ' ... came here from the home world,' she read. 'To offer thanks <span class='centered'> and bring you ... courage.' <span class='centered'> Azelia said, 'Who thanks whom for what?' <span class='centered'> 'It's from the ancestors,' she said. 'They're going to come here and <span class='centered'> write this. They're going to come here to tell us that everything we've <span class='centered'> done and everything we've been through was worth it in the end.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> But ever since he'd seen the writing for himself, he'd been unable to stop <span class='centered'> wondering if the message suited him too well. As far as he could recall, he'd <span class='centered'> never consciously planned to commit any kind of hoax.  What he didn't know was <span class='centered'> exactly what his lack of preparation meant. The words were there, nothing could <span class='centered'> change that now. But with every moment that passed it seemed more likely to him <span class='centered'> that the ancestors had nothing to do with it, and that he would find a way to <span class='centered'> write the message himself. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> To feel alive, he needed to feel himself struggling moment by <span class='centered'> moment to shape his own history. It was not enough to look down <span class='centered'> on events from above like a biologist watching a worm in a maze, <span class='centered'> content to note that this creature's actions had never actually gone <span class='centered'> against its wishes. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> nothing helped a plan run more smoothly than having a law of physics on its side </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> How could he carve anything into the rock face, if the idea of doing <span class='centered'> it had only come to him after he'd seen the result? Even the choice <span class='centered'> of words hadn't sounded like his own. If he'd only selected them <span class='centered'> because he'd read them, who would have made the choice? No one. <span class='centered'> Agata had told him endlessly: a loop could never contain complexity <span class='centered'> with no antecedent but itself, because the probability would be far <span class='centered'> too low. There could be no words appearing on rocks for no other <span class='centered'> reason than the fact that they'd done so. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'We've all hit a dead patch,' Lila said sadly. 'Chemists, biologists, <span class='centered'> astronomers, engineers. Since they switched on the messaging <span class='centered'> system, there hasn't been a single new idea across the mountain.' <span class='centered'> 'You mean no one's been sending back new ideas?' Agata had <span class='centered'> predicted as much - but surely that self-censorship hadn't surprised <span class='centered'> anyone. <span class='centered'> 'Oh, the messages have contained no innovations,' Lila confirmed. <span class='centered'> 'But neither has the work itself.' <span class='centered'> 'I don't understand,' Agata admitted. <span class='centered'> Lila said, 'If people did innovate, the results would leak back to <span class='centered'> them one way or another. I know you believed that they'd be able <span class='centered'> to keep qUiet, so everything would go on as usual. But everything <span class='centered'> has not gone on as usual. We've had no new ideas since the system <span class='centered'> was turned on - because if we'd had them, we would have heard of <span class='centered'> them before we'd had a chance to think of them ourselves. The <span class='centered'> barriers to information flow are so porous now that the knowledge <span class='centered'> gradient has been flattened: the past contains everything the future <span class='centered'> contains ... which means the future contains nothing more than <span class='centered'> the past.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> What would her own generation be famous for? Rendering <span class='centered'> the creation of new knowledge impossible.  </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'I'm where I need to be.' 'In the administrative sense, or the teleological?' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Azelio hummed with frustration. 'What's all this talk of replacement? If a <span class='centered'> meteor is going to hit us, it's going to hit us! You can devise as many <span class='centered'> ingenious plans as you like to try to sabotage the system at the very same <span class='centered'> moment, but if there's a rock on its way, nothing you do is going to make it <span class='centered'> disappear.' 'If there's a rock on its way, that's true,' Ramiro conceded. <span class='centered'> 'But until we know that there is, why should we assume that? The history of <span class='centered'> the next twelve stints ends with the messaging system failing; we're about as <span class='centered'> certain of that as we can be. Some sequence of events has to fill the gap <span class='centered'> between that certainty and all the other things we know. So which snippets <span class='centered'> would you rather the cosmos had on hand to complete the story? Just one, <span class='centered'> where a meteor hits the Peerless? Just two: a meteor, or a bomb? Making our <span class='centered'> own preferred version possible won't rule out everything else - but if we <span class='centered'> don't even try, we'll rule out our own best hope entirely.' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Azelio was looking disoriented. 'I want this to work,' he said <span class='centered'> haltingly. 'But every time I stop and think about it, it feels as if all <span class='centered'> we're doing is playing some kind of game. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Azelio glanced down at the pile of notes on her desk. 'And doesn't <span class='centered'> everything that could happen, happen? Isn't that what your diagram <span class='centered'> calculus says?' <span class='centered'> 'No.' Agata nodded at the pile. 'Por a start, you can only add up <span class='centered'> diagrams that begin and end in exactly the same way: they all take <span class='centered'> different paths, but their end pOints have to be identical. Getting <span class='centered'> to the disruption with benign sabotage leaves the mountain intact; <span class='centered'> getting there with a meteor strike hardly brings you to the same state. <span class='centered'> And even when the end points are identical, all the alternatives you <span class='centered'> draw for a process just help you find the probability that the process <span class='centered'> takes place. Those alternatives don't all get to happen, themselves.' <span class='centered'> 'Then what makes the choice?' Azelio pressed her. 'When a luxagen <span class='centered'> could end up in either of two places, how does just one get picked? </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Just because <span class='centered'> we don't know the cause of the disruption, that doesn't mean that every cause <span class='centered'> we can imagine will coexist. If you want history to unfold a certain way, <span class='centered'> forget about wave mechanics. What matters now are the usual things: who we are, <span class='centered'> what we do, and a certain amount of dumb luck.'  </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> Azelio put the diagram down. 'So if there's a meteor coming, how <span class='centered'> do I stop it? Or avoid it?' <span class='centered'> 'You can't,' Agata replied. This was the sticking point they always <span class='centered'> reached. 'Not if the disruption is the proof that it hits us.' <span class='centered'> 'Then what difference does it make "who we are" and "what we <span class='centered'> do"?' Azelio asked bitterly. 'If I go through the motions of enacting <span class='centered'> something more benign ... how will that help? If there's a murderer <span class='centered'> trying to kill your family, you don't protect them by moving your <span class='centered'> own tympanum to match the threats being shouted through the <span class='centered'> door. Or do you really believe in safety through reverse ventriloquism?' <span class='centered'> Agata wrapped her arms around her head in frustration. 'We don't  <span class='centered'> know that there's a murderer at the door! We don't know that there's a <span class='centered'> meteor on its way!' </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'This is your pass,' the woman <span class='centered'> explained, handing her a red disc. 'Please don't lose it.' <span class='centered'> 'Do I lose it?' Agata asked. <span class='centered'> 'Of course you don't,' the guard replied. 'Because I asked you not <span class='centered'> to.' 'Right.' Agata suppressed a shiver. </blockquote> 
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> 'I didn't make the inscription,' Tarquinia declared. 'I went out there to try, <span class='centered'> but nothing happened: no shards of stone rose from the ground to meet the <span class='centered'> chisel. I tried different tools, different movements ... but I couldn't unwrite <span class='centered'> those symbols. If anything, when I left they were sharper than I'd found them - <span class='centered'> as if all I'd done was make the message less clear for Agata and Azelio than if <span class='centered'> I'd stayed away completely. I wasn't the author of those words. Someone else <span class='centered'> must be responsible for them.' </blockquote>
