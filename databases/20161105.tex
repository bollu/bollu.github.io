\subsubsection{9.1}
\subsubsection{9.2}
Selinger optimization improves upon DP approach by keeping for
each  not only the plan of least cost, but also plans that have higher
cost but produce a result that is sorted in an order that may
be useful for parent queries.
\subsubsection{9.3}

View serializable: If a given schedule is found to be view equivalent to some serial schedule. Alternatively,
  there are no cycles in the dependency graph.
Conflict serializable: If there are no cycles in the conflict graph.


\subsubsection{9.4}

We can use strict 2-phase locking for recoverability. This requires that
in addition to the lock being 2-Phase, all Exclusive(X) Locks held by the
transaction be released until after the Transaction Commits.

\subsubsection{9.5}
Database operations are in fact relational algebra operations. These
operations are pure mathematical expressions, and are generally reads or
writes into disjoint pieces of data. This makes them naturally parallelizable.


\subsubsection{9.6}
File system does not generally have multiple readers and writers to a single
file. It also does not need to manage structured data. Hence, many of the ACID
like concerns simply do not occur in the case of a file system.

\subsubsection{9.7}
\subsubsection{9.8}
\subsubsection{9.9}
\subsubsection{9.10}
all trees of n vertices is $n^{n-2}$. Number of left-deep trees is $n!$.
$n^{n-2}$ is much larger than $n!$.
