 <span class='centered'>I spent this year focusing on fundamentals, and attempting to prepare 
 <span class='centered'>myself for topics I'll need during my PhD. This involved learning things 
 <span class='centered'>about dependent typing, compiling functional programs, working with the 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://mlir.llvm.org/><span class='centered'>MLIR compiler toolchain </a>, and reading about 
 <span class='centered'>the  <a href=https://www.gap-system.org/><span class='centered'>GAP system for computational discrete algebra </a>.  
 <h3><a id=guitar href='#guitar'> § </a><span class='centered'> Guitar </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I've been meaning to pick up an instrument. I'd learnt the piano as a kid, 
 <span class='centered'>but I'd soured on the experience as it felt like I was learning a lot of music 
 <span class='centered'>theory and practising to clear the  <a href=https://in.abrsm.org/en/><span class='centered'>Royal school of music exams </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I'd learnt a little bit of playing the guitar while I was an inten at  <a href=https://tweag.io/><span class='centered'>Tweag.io </a>; my 
 <span class='centered'>AirBnB host had a guitar which he let me borrow to play with. I was eager to pick it back up.  
 <span class='centered'>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to play as consistenly as I had hoped I would. I can now play more chords, 
 <span class='centered'>but actually switching between them continues to be a challenge. I also find pressing down on barre chords 
 <span class='centered'>surprisingly hard. I've been told something about getting lighter strings, but I'm unsure about that.  
 <span class='centered'>I was also excited about learning the guitar well enough to play it while a friend sings along. 
 <span class='centered'>This seems to require a  <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>lot </i></i> more practice than I currently have, as the bottleneck is whether 
 <span class='centered'>one can smoothly switch between chords.  
 <h3><a id=starting-my-phd-research-on-lean4 href='#starting-my-phd-research-on-lean4'> § </a><span class='centered'> Starting my PhD: Research on Lean4 </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I'm excited by proof assistants, and I'd like to work on them for my PhD. So the first order 
 <span class='centered'>of business was to get an idea of the internals of Lean4, and to decide what exactly I would 
 <span class='centered'>be working on. This made me read the papers written by the Lean team over the last couple years 
 <span class='centered'>about their runtime, as well as made me learn how to implement dependently typed languages.  
 <span class='centered'>During this process, I also had calls with some of the faculty at the University of Edinburgh 
 <span class='centered'>to pick a co-advisor. I enjoyed reading 
 <span class='centered'><a href=http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:61747/SOURCE02?view=true><span class='centered'>Liam O connor's thesis: Type Systems for Systems Types </a>
 <span class='centered'>The thesis had a very raw, heartfelt epilogue:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> If you will permit some vain pontification on the last page of my thesis, <span class='centered'> I would like to reflect on this undertaking, and on the dramatic effect it <span class='centered'> has had on my thinking. My once-co-supervisor Toby Murray said that <span class='centered'> all graduate students enter into a valley of despair where they no longer believe in <span class='centered'> the value of their work. Certainly I am no counter-example. I do not even know if I <span class='centered'> successfully found my way out of it </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>This, honestly, made me feel a lot better, since I'd begun to feel this way even  <i><span class='centered'>before </i> launching 
 <span class='centered'>into a PhD!  
 <h4><a id=lean-implementation-details href='#lean-implementation-details'> § </a><span class='centered'> Lean implementation details </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I read the papers by the Lean researchers on the special features of the language.  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05647.pdf><span class='centered'>Counting immutable beans </a> describes an optimization <span class='centered'>that they perform in their IR (lambdarc) that optimizes memory usage by exploiting linear types. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01685.pdf><span class='centered'>Sealing pointer equality </a> describes how to use dependent types <span class='centered'>to hide pointer manipulation in a referentially transparent fashion. </li></ul> 
 <h4><a id=writing-a-dependently-typed-language href='#writing-a-dependently-typed-language'> § </a><span class='centered'> Writing a dependently typed language </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I felt I had to know how to write a dependently typed language if I wanted to be successful 
 <span class='centered'>at working on the Lean theorem prover. So I wrote one, it's at   <a href=git@github.com:bollu/minitt.git><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>bollu/minitt</code></a>. 
 <span class='centered'>The tutorials that helped me the most were:  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/><span class='centered'>David Christiansen's tutorial on normalization by evaluation </a>, where <span class='centered'>he builds a full blown, small dependently typed language type checker.  </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atKqqiXslyo><span class='centered'>Normalization by evaluation by F. Faviona </a> which explains <span class='centered'>why we need this algorithm to implement dependently typed languages, and other cute examples <span class='centered'>of normal forms in mathematics. For example, to check if two lists are equivalent upto permutation, <span class='centered'>we can first sort the two lists, and then check for real equality. So we are reducing a problem <span class='centered'>of "equivalence" to a problem of "reduction to sorted order" followed by "equality". We do something <span class='centered'>similar to type check a dependently typed language. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cLUwAiQU6Q><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>cubicaltt</code> lectures by faviona </a>, which get the point of <span class='centered'>cubical type theory across very well. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'>  <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15312-f04/handouts/15-bidirectional.pdf><span class='centered'>Bidirectional type checking by Pfenning </a><span class='centered'>These lecture notes explain bidirectional typing <span class='centered'>well, and provide an intuition for which types should be checked and which should be inferred when performing <span class='centered'>bidirectional typing. </li></ul> 
 <h4><a id=paper-acceptance href='#paper-acceptance'> § </a><span class='centered'> Paper acceptance </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Our research about writing a custom backend for Lean4 was accepted at CGO'22. I was very touched at how 
 <span class='centered'>nice the programming languages community is. For example, Leonaro De Moura and Sebastian Ullrich, the maintainers 
 <span class='centered'>of Lean4 provided a lot of constructive feedback. I definitely did not expect this to happen. I feel like 
 <span class='centered'>I don't understand academia as a community, to be honest, and I'd like to understand how it's organized.  
 <h3><a id=statistics href='#statistics'> § </a><span class='centered'> Statistics </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>As I was working on the paper, I realised that I didn't truly understand why we were taking the median of the runtimes 
 <span class='centered'>to report performance numbers, or why averaging over ten runs was "sufficient" (sufficient for what?).  
 <span class='centered'>This led me on a quest to learn statistics correctly. My big takeaways were:  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Frequentist type statistics via null hypotheses are hard to interpret and may not be well suited for performance benchmarking. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> The High Performance Computing community does not use bayesian statistics, so using it would flag one's paper as "weird". </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> The best solution is to probably report all raw data, and summarize it via reasonable summary statistics like median, which <span class='centered'>is robust to outliers. </li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>I must admit, I find the entire situation very unsatisfactory. I would love it if researchers in High performance 
 <span class='centered'>computing wrote good reference material on how to bencharmk well. Regardless, here are some of the neat 
 <span class='centered'>things I wound up reading in this quest:  
 <h4><a id=learning-statistics-with-r href='#learning-statistics-with-r'> § </a><span class='centered'> Learning statistics with R </h4> 
 <span class='centered'><a href=htps://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/><span class='centered'>Learning statistics with R </a>. This is a neat book which explains 
 <span class='centered'>statistics and the  <code class='inline'>R</code> programming language. I knew basically nothing of statistics and had never used  <code class='inline'>R</code>, so working 
 <span class='centered'>through the book was a blast. I was able to blaze through the first half of the book, since it's a lot of introductory 
 <span class='centered'>programming and introductory math. I had to take a while to digest the ideas of p-values and hypothesis testing. I'm still not 
 <span class='centered'>100% confident I really understand what the hell a p value is doing. Regardless, the book was a really nice read, and 
 <span class='centered'>it made me realize just how well the R language is designed.  
 <h4><a id=jackknife href='#jackknife'> § </a><span class='centered'> Jackknife </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>The  <a href=http://jeti.uni-freiburg.de/studenten_seminar/stud_sem_SS_09/EfronBootstrap.pdf><span class='centered'>Jackknife paper "Bootstrap methods: another look at the jackknife" </a>
 <span class='centered'>which introduces the technique of bootstrapping: drawing many samples from a small dataset to eventually infer summary statistics. I was impressed 
 <span class='centered'>by the paper for three reasons. For one, it was quite easy to read as a non-statistician, and I could follow the gist of what was going on 
 <span class='centered'>in the proofs. Secondly, I enjoyed how amenable it is to implementation, which makes it widely used in software. Finally, I think it's 
 <span class='centered'>a great piece of marketing: labelling it a "Jacknife", and describing how to bootstrap is a rough-and-ready method that will save you 
 <span class='centered'>in the jungles of statistical wilderness makes for a great title.  
 <h3><a id=r-language-and-tidy-data href='#r-language-and-tidy-data'> § </a><span class='centered'> R language and tidy data </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>Due to the R lannguage quest, I was exposed to the idea of a data frame in a  <i><span class='centered'>coherent </i> way. 
 <span class='centered'>The data frames in R feels  <i><span class='centered'>designed </i> to me, unlike their python counterpart in  <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>pandas</code></a>.  
 <span class='centered'>I realised that I should probably learn languages that are used by domain experts, and not poor approximations 
 <span class='centered'>of domain expertise in Python.   
 <h4><a id=tidyverse href='#tidyverse'> § </a><span class='centered'> Tidyverse </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>This also got me interested to learn about the  <a href=https://www.tidyverse.org/><span class='centered'>tidyverse </a>, a collection of packages 
 <span class='centered'>which define a notion of "tidy data", which is a precise philosophy of how data should be formatted when 
 <span class='centered'>working on data science (roughly speaking, it's a dataset analogy of  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form><span class='centered'>3rd normal form from database theory </a>.  
 <span class='centered'>In particular, I really enjoyed the  <a href=https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf><span class='centered'>tidy data </a> paper which 
 <span class='centered'>defines tidy data, explains how to tidy untidy data, and advocates for using tidy data as an intermediate 
 <span class='centered'>representation for data analysis.  
 <h3><a id=starting-a-reading-group-fuzzing href='#starting-a-reading-group-fuzzing'> § </a><span class='centered'> Starting a reading group: Fuzzing </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I felt like I was missing out on hanging with folks from my research lab, so I decided 
 <span class='centered'>to start a reading group. We picked  <a href=https://www.fuzzingbook.org/><span class='centered'>the fuzzing book </a>
 <span class='centered'>as the book to read, since it seemed an easy and interesting read.  
 <span class='centered'>I broadly enjoyed the book. Since it was written in a  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming><span class='centered'>literate programming style </a>, 
 <span class='centered'>this meant that we could read the sources of each chapter and get a clear idea of how the associated topic was to be implemented. 
 <span class='centered'>I enjoy reading code, but I felt that the other lab members thought this was too verbose. It did make judging the length of 
 <span class='centered'>a particular section hard, since it was unclear how much of the section was pure implementation detail, and how much was conceptual.  
 <h4><a id=ideas-learnt href='#ideas-learnt'> § </a><span class='centered'> Ideas learnt </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Overall, I learnt some interesting ideas like  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_debugging><span class='centered'>delta debugging </a>, 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/ConcolicFuzzer.html><span class='centered'>concolic fuzzing </a>, and overall, how to  <i><span class='centered'>design </i>
 <span class='centered'>a fuzzing library (for example, this section on  <a href=https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/GeneratorGrammarFuzzer.html#Synopsis><span class='centered'>grammar fuzzing </a>
 <span class='centered'>provides a convenient class hierarchy one could choose to follow).  
 <span class='centered'>I also really enjoyed the book's many (ab)uses of python's 
 <span class='centered'>runtime monkey-patching capabilities for fuzzing. This meant that the book could easily explain concepts 
 <span class='centered'>that would have been much harder in some other setting, but this also meant that some of the techniques 
 <span class='centered'>showcased (eg.  <a href=https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/InformationFlow.html><span class='centered'>tracking information flow </a>  
 <span class='centered'>by using the fact that python is dynamically typed) would be much harder to put into practice in a less flexible language.  
 <h4><a id=software-bugs-are-real-bugs href='#software-bugs-are-real-bugs'> § </a><span class='centered'> Software bugs are real bugs? </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>The coolest thing I learnt from the book was  <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02130.pdf><span class='centered'>STADS: software testing as species discovery </a>, 
 <span class='centered'>which models the problem of "how many bugs exist in the program?" as "how many bugs exist in this forest?". It turns 
 <span class='centered'>out that ecologists have good models for approximating the  <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>total number of species in a habitat </i></i> from the 
 <span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>number of known species in a habitat </i></i>. The paper then proceeds to argue that this analogy is sensible, 
 <span class='centered'>and then implements this within  <a href=https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/><span class='centered'>AFL: american fuzzy lop </a>. Definitely the 
 <span class='centered'>most fun idea in the book by far.  
 <h3><a id=persistent-data-structures-for-compilers href='#persistent-data-structures-for-compilers'> § </a><span class='centered'> Persistent data structures for compilers </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>My friend and fellow PhD student  <a href=https://github.com/math-fehr><span class='centered'>Mathieu Fehr </a> is developing 
 <span class='centered'>a new compiler framework based on MLIR called  <a href=https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl><span class='centered'>XDSL </a>.  
 <span class='centered'>This is being developed in Python, as it's meant to be a way to expose the guts of the compilation 
 <span class='centered'>pipeline to domain experts who need not be too familiar with how compilers work.   
 <h4><a id=python-and-immutable-data-structures href='#python-and-immutable-data-structures'> § </a><span class='centered'> Python and immutable data structures </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I wished to convince Mathieu to make the data structures immutable by default. Unfortunately, python's 
 <span class='centered'>support for immutable style programming is pretty poor, and I never could get libraries like 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent><span class='centered'>pyrsistent </a> to work well.   
 <h4><a id=immer href='#immer'> § </a><span class='centered'> Immer </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>On a happier note, this made me search for what the cutting was in embedding immutable 
 <span class='centered'>data structures in a mutable language, which led me to  <a href=https://public.sinusoid.es/misc/immer/immer-icfp17.pdf><span class='centered'>Immer: Persistence for the masses </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>It advocates to use  <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858949.2784739><span class='centered'>RRB trees </a> and describes how to design an API 
 <span class='centered'>that makes it convenient to use within a language like C++. I haven't read the RRB trees paper, but I have been using Immer 
 <span class='centered'>and I'm liking it so far.  
 <h3><a id=ward-for-quick-blackboarding href='#ward-for-quick-blackboarding'> § </a><span class='centered'>  <code class='inline'>WARD</code> for quick blackboarding </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I hang out with my friends to discuss math, and the one thing I was sorely missing was the lack of a shared 
 <span class='centered'>blackboard. I wanted a tool that would let me quickly sketch pictures, with some undo/redo, but most importantly, 
 <span class='centered'>be  <i><span class='centered'><i><span class='centered'>fast </i></i>. I found no such tool on Linux, so I wrote my own:  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/ward><span class='centered'>bollu/ward </a>. I was great 
 <span class='centered'>fun to write a tool to scratch a personal itch. I should do this more often.  
 <h3><a id=becoming-a-demoscener href='#becoming-a-demoscener'> § </a><span class='centered'> Becoming a Demoscener </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I've always wanted to become a part of the  <a href=><span class='centered'>demoscene </a>, but I felt that I didn't understand the 
 <span class='centered'>graphics pipeline or the audio synthesis pipeline well enough. I decided to fix these glaring 
 <span class='centered'>gaps in my knowledge.   
 <h4><a id=rasterization href='#rasterization'> § </a><span class='centered'> Rasterization </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I've been implementing  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/rasterizer><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>bollu/rasterizer</code></a>, which  
 <span class='centered'>follows the  <a href=https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>tinyrenderer</code></a> series 
 <span class='centered'>of tutorials to implement a from-scratch, by-hand software rasterizer. I already knew 
 <span class='centered'>all the math involved, so it was quite rewarding to quickly put together code that applied math I already knew 
 <span class='centered'>to make pretty pictures.  
 <h4><a id=audio-synthesis href='#audio-synthesis'> § </a><span class='centered'> Audio synthesis </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Similarly, on the audio synthesis side, I wrote  
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://github.com/bollu/soundsynth><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>bollu/soundsynth</code></a> to learn fundamental synthesis algorithms. 
 <span class='centered'>I followed  <a href=https://blog.demofox.org/><span class='centered'>demofox's series of audio synththesis tutorials </a> as well as 
 <span class='centered'>the very pleasant and gently paced textbook  [TODO}(). I particularly enjoyed the ideas 
 <span class='centered'>in  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis><span class='centered'>karlplus strong string synthesis </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I find  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/soundsynth/blob/master/fm-paper.pdf><span class='centered'>FM synthesis </a> very counter-intuitive to reason about. 
 <span class='centered'>I've been told that audio engineers can perform FM sound synthesis "by ear", and I'd love to have an intuition for  
 <span class='centered'>frequency space that's so strong that I can intuit how to FM synthesize a sound. Regardless, the idea is very neat for sure.  
 <h4><a id=plucker-coordinates href='#plucker-coordinates'> § </a><span class='centered'> Plucker coordinates </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I also have long wanted to understand 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates><span class='centered'>Plucker coordinates </a>, since I'd read that they are useful 
 <span class='centered'>for graphics programming. I eventually plonked down, studied them, and 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/diffgeo/grassmanian-plucker.ipynb><span class='centered'>wrote down an expository note </a>
 <span class='centered'>about them in a way that makes sense to me. I now feel I have a better handle on Projective space, Grassmanians, and schemes!  
 <h3><a id=category-theory href='#category-theory'> § </a><span class='centered'> Category theory </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>A friend started a category theory reading group, so we've spent the year working 
 <span class='centered'>through  
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf><span class='centered'>Emily Riehl's "Category theory in Context" </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I'd seen categorical ideas before, like colimits to define a germ, "right adjoints preserve limits", 
 <span class='centered'>showing that the sheafification functor exists by invoking an adjoint functor theorem, and so on.  
 <span class='centered'>But I'd never systematically studied any of this, and if I'm being honest, I hadn't even understood 
 <span class='centered'>the statement of the Yoneda lemma properly.  
 <h4><a id=thoughts-on-the-textbook href='#thoughts-on-the-textbook'> § </a><span class='centered'> Thoughts on the textbook </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Working through the book from the ground-up was super useful, since I was forced to solve 
 <span class='centered'>exercises and think about limits, adjoints, and so forth. I've 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/category-theory-in-context/main.pdf><span class='centered'>uploaded my solutions upto Chapter 4 </a>.  
 <span class='centered'>I felt the textbook gets a little rough around the edges at the chapter on adjunctions. The section 
 <span class='centered'>on the 'Calculus of Adjunctions' made so little sense to me that I 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/category-theory-in-context/calculus-of-adjunctions.pdf><span class='centered'>rewrote it </a>
 <span class='centered'>with proofs that I could actually grok/believe.  
 <h4><a id=curios href='#curios'> § </a><span class='centered'> Curios </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Regardless, it's been a fun read so far. I was also pointed to some other interesting content along 
 <span class='centered'>the way, like  <a href=https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/08/26/lawvere-theories/><span class='centered'>Lawvere theories </a>
 <span class='centered'>and the  <a href=http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/2/tr2abs.html><span class='centered'>cohomology associated to a monad </a>.  
 <h3><a id=computational-mathematics href='#computational-mathematics'> § </a><span class='centered'> Computational mathematics </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>A Postdoc at our lab,  <a href=https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=vjVhbJoAAAAJ&hl=en><span class='centered'>Andres Goens </a>  
 <span class='centered'>comes from a pure math background. While we were discussing potential research ideas (since I'm still 
 <span class='centered'>trying to formulate my plan for PhD), he 
 <span class='centered'>mentioned that we could provide a formal semantics for the 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://www.gap-system.org/><span class='centered'>GAP programming language </a> in Lean. 
 <span class='centered'>This project is definitely up my alley, since it involves computational math (yay), Lean (yay), 
 <span class='centered'>and formal verification (yay).   
 <h4><a id=learning-gap href='#learning-gap'> § </a><span class='centered'> Learning GAP </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I decided I needed to know some fundamental algorithms of computational group theory, so I skimmed 
 <span class='centered'>the book 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://doc.lagout.org/science/0_Computer%20Science/2_Algorithms/Permutation%20Group%20Algorithms%20%5BSeress%202003-03-17%5D.pdf><span class='centered'>Permutation group algorithms by Serees </a>
 <span class='centered'>which explains the fundamental algorithms behind manipulating finite groups computationally, such 
 <span class='centered'>as the  <a href=https://math.berkeley.edu/~kmill/notes/todd_coxeter.html><span class='centered'>Todd Coxeter coset enumeration algorithm </a>
 <span class='centered'>and the  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreier%E2%80%93Sims_algorithm><span class='centered'>Schrier Sims group decomposition algorithm </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I loved the ideas involved, and implemented these at  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/CASette><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>bollu/CASette</code></a>.  
 <span class='centered'>I'd also half-read the textbook 'Cox, Little, OShea: Computational Algebraic Geometry' which I picked 
 <span class='centered'>up again since I felt like I ought to revisit it after I had seen more algebraic geometry, and also 
 <span class='centered'>because I wanted to be better informed about computational mathematics. I felt like this time around, 
 <span class='centered'>I felt many of the theorems (such as the  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_basis_theorem><span class='centered'>hilbert basis theorem </a>)  
 <span class='centered'>'in my bones'. Alas, I couldn't proceed more than the second chapter since other life things took priorty. 
 <span class='centered'>Perhaps I'll actually finish this book next year  <code class='inline'>:)</code>.  
 <h4><a id=cardistry href='#cardistry'> § </a><span class='centered'> Cardistry </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>For something completely different, I got interested in Cardistry and shuffling thanks to Youtube. 
 <span class='centered'>I started learning interesting shuffles like the  <a href=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiffleShuffle.html><span class='centered'>riffle shuffle </a>, 
 <span class='centered'>and soon got interested in the mathematics involved. I would up reading some of  
 <span class='centered'>the book  <a href=https://jdc.math.uwo.ca/M9140a-2012-summer/Diaconis.pdf><span class='centered'>Group representations for probability and statistics </a>
 <span class='centered'>by Persi Diaconis, a magician turned mathematician who publishes quite a bit on permutation groups, shuffling, and the like.  
 <h4><a id=symmetric-group href='#symmetric-group'> § </a><span class='centered'> Symmetric group </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I really enjoyed learning the detailed theory of the representation theory of the symmetric group, which I 
 <span class='centered'>had read patchily before while studying 
 <span class='centered'><a href=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~risi/research/symmetric.html><span class='centered'>Fourier analysis on the symmetric group </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>A lot of the theory 
 <span class='centered'>still feels like magic to me; in particular,  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specht_module><span class='centered'>Specht modules </a> are so 
 <span class='centered'>'magic' that I would find it hard to reconstruct them from memory.  
 <h3><a id=competitive-peogramming href='#competitive-peogramming'> § </a><span class='centered'> Competitive peogramming </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I need more practice at competitive programming. In fact, I'm  <a href=https://codeforces.com/profile/bollu><span class='centered'>downright atrocious </a>, 
 <span class='centered'>as I'm rated "pupil" on codeforces. If I had to debug, it's a combination of several factors:  
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> I get discouraged if I can't solve a problem I think I "ought to be able to solve". </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> I consider myself good at math and programming, and thus being bad at problem solving makes me feel  <span class='centered'>bad about myself. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> I tend to overthink problems, and I enjoy using heavy algorithmic machinery, when in reality, all that's called for <span class='centered'>is a sequence of several observations. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Codeforces' scoring system needs one to be  <i><span class='centered'>fast </i> at solving problems and implementing them precisely. I don't enjoy <span class='centered'>the time pressure. I'd like a scoring system based on harder problems, but less emphasis on time-to-solve.  </li></ul> 
 <span class='centered'>To get better, I've been studying more algorithms (because it's fun). I took the 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings><span class='centered'>coursera course on string algorithms </a> and  
 <span class='centered'>read the textbook  <a href=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/algorithms-on-strings/19049704C876795D95D8882C73257C70><span class='centered'>algorithms on strings </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I loved the ideas of  <a href=https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20861><span class='centered'>building a prefix automata in linear time </a>. The algorithm 
 <span class='centered'>is vey elegant, and involves a fundamental decomposition of regular grammar 
 <span class='centered'> via the  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myhill%E2%80%93Nerode_theorem><span class='centered'>Myhill Nerode theorem </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>You can find  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/tree/master/strings/impl><span class='centered'>my string algorithm implementations here </a>.  
 <h4><a id=hardness-of-codeforces-problems href='#hardness-of-codeforces-problems'> § </a><span class='centered'> Hardness of codeforces problems </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Another thing I kept getting tripped up by was the fact that problems that were rated "easy" on codeforces 
 <span class='centered'>tended to have  <i><span class='centered'>intuitive </i> solutions, but with  <i><span class='centered'>non-trivial </i> watertight proofs. An example of this 
 <span class='centered'>was the question  <a href=https://codeforces.com/contest/545/problem/C><span class='centered'>545C </a> on codeforces, where the 
 <span class='centered'>tutorial gives a  <a href=https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/17982><span class='centered'>sketch of a exchange argument </a>. Unfortunately, 
 <span class='centered'>filling in all the gaps in the exchange argument is  <a href=https://gist.github.com/bollu/6b9d7d4b23cc4dd74d6a0fc2b66f452c><span class='centered'>quite complicated </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I finally did arrive at a much longer proof. This made me realize that competitive programming sometimes calls for 
 <span class='centered'>"leaps" that are in fact quite hard to justify. This kept happening as I solved problems. To recitfy the state of affairs, 
 <span class='centered'>I began documenting formal proofs to these problems. Here's a link to  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/competitive-programming/main.pdf><span class='centered'>my competitive programming notes </a>, 
 <span class='centered'>which attempts to formally state and prove the correctness of these questions.  
 <h3><a id=discrete-differential-geometry href='#discrete-differential-geometry'> § </a><span class='centered'> Discrete differential geometry </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I love the research of  <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/><span class='centered'>Keenan Crane </a>, who works on bridging old school 
 <span class='centered'>differential geometry with computational techniques. All of his papers are lucid, full of beautiful figures 
 <span class='centered'>and crazy ideas.   
 <h4><a id=replusive-curves href='#replusive-curves'> § </a><span class='centered'> Replusive curves </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Chris Yu, Henrik Schumacherm, and Keenan have a new paper on  <a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/RepulsiveCurves/RepulsiveCurves.pdf><span class='centered'>Repulsive Curves </a>
 <span class='centered'>is really neat. It allows one to create curves that minimize a repulsive force, and can be subject to other arbitrary 
 <span class='centered'>constraints. The actual algorithm design leads one to think about all sorts of things like fractional calculus. To be honest, 
 <span class='centered'>I find it insane that fractional calculus finds a practical use. Definitely a cool read.  
 <h4><a id=sage-implementation href='#sage-implementation'> § </a><span class='centered'> SAGE implementation </h4> 
 <ul><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> I have a  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/SAGE/tree/u/gh-bollu%2Fjan-17-2021-discrete-diffgeo-homology><span class='centered'>work in progress PR </a> that <span class='centered'>implements Keenan Crane's  <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6216><span class='centered'>Geodesics in Heat </a> algorithms <span class='centered'>within SAGE. Unfortunately, the problem was this implementing this requires heavy sparse numerical linear algebra, <span class='centered'>something that sage did not have at the time I attempted this. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> This led to me  <a href=https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13674><span class='centered'>opening an issue about sparse Cholesky decomposition </a><span class='centered'>on the SAGE issue tracker. </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> Happily, the issue was fixed late this year by SAGE pulling in  <code class='inline'>cvxopt</code> as a dependency! </li><li><span class='centered'><span class='centered'> I can get back to this now in 2022, since there's enough support within SAGE now to actually succeed! </li></ul> 
 <h3><a id=writing-a-text-editor-dropped href='#writing-a-text-editor-dropped'> § </a><span class='centered'> Writing a text editor (dropped) </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I started writing a text editor, because earlier tools that I'd written for myself 
 <span class='centered'>such as  <code class='inline'>ward</code> for blackboarding, and my custom blog generator all worked really well for me, 
 <span class='centered'>as they fit to my idiosyncracies. I tried writing a terminal based editor 
 <span class='centered'>at  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/edtr><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>bollu/edtr</code></a> following the  <a href=https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/><span class='centered'><code class='inline'>kilo</code> tutorial </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>Unfortunately, building a text editor is hard work, especially if one wants modern convenienes like 
 <span class='centered'>auto-complete.  
 <span class='centered'>I've postponed this project as one I shall undertake during the dark night of the soul every PhD student 
 <span class='centered'>encounters when writing their thesis. I plan to write a minimal lazily evaluated language, and great 
 <span class='centered'>tooling around that language as a means to while away time. But this is for future me!  
 <h3><a id=dnd href='#dnd'> § </a><span class='centered'> DnD </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>My partner got me into playing dungeons and dragons this year. I had a lot of fun 
 <span class='centered'>role-playing, and I plan to keep it up.  
 <h4><a id=nomic href='#nomic'> § </a><span class='centered'> Nomic </h4> 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic><span class='centered'>Nomic </a>
 <span class='centered'>is a neat game about changing the rules of the game. It takes a particular 
 <span class='centered'>type of person to enjoy it, I find, but if you have the type of people who 
 <span class='centered'>enjoy C++ template language lawyering, you'll definitely have a blast!  
 <h4><a id=continuum href='#continuum'> § </a><span class='centered'> Continuum </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I found  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(role-playing_game><span class='centered'>the continuum RPG </a>), 
 <span class='centered'>a game about time travel  
 <span class='centered'>very unique, due to the massive amount of lore that surrounds it, 
 <span class='centered'>and game mechanics which revolve around creating time paradoxes to deal damage 
 <span class='centered'>to those stuck in it. It appears to have a reputation of being a game 
 <span class='centered'>that everybody loves but nobody plays.  
 <h4><a id=microscope href='#microscope'> § </a><span class='centered'> Microscope </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Microscope is a  <a href=https://www.lamemage.com/microscope/><span class='centered'>game about storytelling </a>. I unfortunately 
 <span class='centered'>was never able to host it properly because I was busy, and when I wasn't busy, I was unsure 
 <span class='centered'>of my abilities as dungeon master  <code class='inline'>:)</code> But it definitely is a game I'd be stoked to play. 
 <span class='centered'>I'm thnking of running it early 2022 with my group of friends.  
 <h4><a id=preparing-for-phd href='#preparing-for-phd'> § </a><span class='centered'> Preparing for PhD </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I was at home this year, wrapping up my master's thesis, and attempting to 
 <span class='centered'>accept the PhD position I was offered by  <a href=https://grosser.science/><span class='centered'>Dr. Tobias Grosser </a> at the University of Edinburgh. 
 <span class='centered'>I've worked with Tobias for, I suppose, four years now, and he's an incredible advisor. We understand 
 <span class='centered'>each other really well, and he totally gets the type of things I enjoy, and the failure modes 
 <span class='centered'>I have (the lack of a priority queue, for example). It's great to have the feeling that I have 
 <span class='centered'>an extremely supportive advisor   
 <h3><a id=odds-and-ends href='#odds-and-ends'> § </a><span class='centered'> Odds and ends </h3> 
 <h4><a id=the-portal-group href='#the-portal-group'> § </a><span class='centered'> The portal group </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>I joined the  <a href=https://theportal.group/><span class='centered'>portal group </a> on discord, which consist of folks 
 <span class='centered'>who follow Eric Weinstein's philosophy, broadly speaking. The discod is a strange mileu. I hung 
 <span class='centered'>around because there were folks who knew a  <i><span class='centered'>lot </i> of math and physics. I would up 
 <span class='centered'>watching the  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic><span class='centered'>geometric anatomy of theoretical physics </a>
 <span class='centered'>lectures on YouTube by Fredrick Schuller. The lectures are great expository material, though the hardness 
 <span class='centered'>ramps up like a cliff towards the end, because it feels like he stops proving things and beings to simply 
 <span class='centered'>state results. Regardless, I learnt a lot from it. I think my favourite takeaway was the 
 <span class='centered'><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre%E2%80%93Swan_theorem><span class='centered'>Serre Swann theorem </a> which makes 
 <span class='centered'>very precise the idea that "projective modules are like vector bundles".  
 <h4><a id=differential-geometry-again href='#differential-geometry-again'> § </a><span class='centered'> Differential geometry, again </h4> 
 <span class='centered'>Similarly, I would up realizing that my differential geometry was in fact quite weak, in terms 
 <span class='centered'>of computing things in coordinates. So I wound up re-reading 
 <span class='centered'><a href=http://www2.ing.unipi.it/griff/files/dC.pdf><span class='centered'>Do carmo: differential geometry of curves and surfaces </a>, and I implemented 
 <span class='centered'>the coordinate based computations in Jupyter notebooks. For example, 
 <span class='centered'>here is a  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/diffgeo/geodesics.ipynb><span class='centered'>Jupyter notebook that calculates covariant derivatives explicitly </a>. 
 <span class='centered'>I found that this forced me to understand what was "really going on". I now know slogans like:  
 <blockquote><span class='centered'> The Covariant Derivative is the projection of the global derivative onto the tangent space. <span class='centered'> The Christoffel Symbols measure the second dervative(acceleration) along the tangent space. </blockquote> 
 <span class='centered'>I got interested in the work of  <a href=https://polgreen.github.io/><span class='centered'>Elizaboth Polgreen </a>. In particular, 
 <span class='centered'>I found the idea of being able to extend an SMT solver with arbitrary black-box functions pretty great. 
 <span class='centered'>I read their  <a href=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2021/EECS-2021-10.pdf><span class='centered'>technical report on SMT modulo oracles </a>
 <span class='centered'>and  <a href=https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/smt-modulo-oracles.ipynb><span class='centered'>implemented the algorithm </a>.  
 <h3><a id=what-i-want-for-next-year href='#what-i-want-for-next-year'> § </a><span class='centered'> What I want for next year </h3> 
 <span class='centered'>I wish to learn how to focus on one thing. I'm told that the point of a PhD is to become a world 
 <span class='centered'>expert on one topic. I don't have a good answer of what I wish to become a world expert on. I like 
 <span class='centered'>the varied interessts I have, so it'll be interesting as to how this pans out. However, I have 
 <span class='centered'>decided to place all my bets on the Lean ecosystem, and I plan on spending most of 2022 writing 
 <span class='centered'>Lean code almost always (or perhaps even always). I wish to understand all parts of the Lean compiler, 
 <span class='centered'>from the frontend with its advanced macro system, to the middle end with its dependent typing, 
 <span class='centered'>to the back-end. In short, I want to become an expert on the Lean4 compiler  <code class='inline'>:)</code>. Let's see how 
 <span class='centered'>far along I get!
